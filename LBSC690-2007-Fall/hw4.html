<p><b>Design a Database</b></p>

<p>You are fed up with ridiculous book prices!  With your new-found
knowledge of relational databases, you've decided to create a website
for University of Maryland students to buy and sell used textbooks.
The site will have four major functionalities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Students selling books must be able to post a "book for sale" ad.</li>
  <li>Students looking for books must be able to post a "book wanted" ad.</li>
  <li>Students selling books must be able to search "book wanted" ads.</li>
  <li>Students looking for books must be able to search "book for sale" ads.</li>
</ul>

<p>Develop this website.  The deliverables for this assignment consist
of three items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An interface mock-up.  There must be at least two different ways
  to search "book wanted" ads, and two different ways to search for
  "book for sale" ads.  Don't forget that this mock-up must be
  well-designed and well laid-out.</li>

  <li>A specification for the database.  Describe what tables and what
  fields you would have.  Identify the primary keys and foreign keys.
  (You can use HTML tables for displaying your ideas; show a few
  sample records).  Think about how you would lay out the relevant
  relations, taking into consideration issues such as
  normalization.</li>

  <li>A description of how each of the searches will be executed, in
  terms of join, project, and restrict.</li> 

</ul>
