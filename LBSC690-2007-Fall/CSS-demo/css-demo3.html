<p>I've been an assistant professor in the College of Information
Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park since September,
2004. I'm a member of the Computational Linguistics and Information
Processing (CLIP) Lab at the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies

and Computer Science Department (EECS) from MIT, where I was working
in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
(CSAIL). My Ph.D. thesis was titled Event Structure and the Encoding
of Arguments: The Syntax of the Mandarin and English Verb Phrase.
