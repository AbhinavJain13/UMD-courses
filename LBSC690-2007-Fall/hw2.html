<h2>LBSC 690: Homework #2</h2>

<p><b>Design a Website</b></p>

<p>You are the media specialist in an elementary school.  You have
been asked to develop a new Web interface to assist children in
locating library resources and other resources on the Web.  Here are
some examples of sites with similar purpose:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://catalog.umd.edu/F?RN=821206396">USM Library's catalogusmai</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.prge.lib.md.us/">PG County Library Catalog</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.acornweb.org/kids.html">Arlington Public Library's Kids Catalog</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ipl.org/div/kidspace/">KidSpace at the Internet Public Library</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.childrensbooksonline.org/">Children's Books Online: The Rosetta Project</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.icdlbooks.org/library/basic/index.html">ICDL</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As you're looking through these sites, keep in mind user
interaction issues discussed in class, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does the interface fulfill user expectations?  Does it match the
  mental task model of the user?</li>

  <li>Is the navigation consistent?  Do users always know where they
  are?  Is it easy to get lost?</li>

  <li>How well is the site organized overall?  Are topics coherently
  grouped?  Is it easy to tell what's where?</li>

</ul>

<p>Based on what you think is effective and ineffective in these
digital libraries and library catalogs, develop a Web interface to
support elementary-age children in finding books in your collection as
well as resources online (decide what online resource you think are
appropriate!).  "Develop a Web interface" as in create a mock-up; for
example, the search functionality doesn't have to work, links don't
necessary have to go anywhere.  The Web mock-up should contain at
least three pages and demonstrate understanding of user interface
design principles.</p>
