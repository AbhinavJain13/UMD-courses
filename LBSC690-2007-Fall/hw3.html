<h2>LBSC 690: Homework #3</h2>

<p><a href="index.html">Back to main page</a></p>

<p><b>Design a Website (Revisited!)</b></p>

<p>You get another shot at homework 2!  Take what you've learned since
the last assignment to provide a revised mock-up of the Website you
designed for homework 2.  You should expand your content so that the
site now contains at least five pages in total.  <b>Do not</b> delete
the previous version, as we will be comparing the two versions
side-by-side. Use of CSS is expected, as well as other HTML elements
(tables, lists, etc.), as appropriate.  We are looking for evidence of
increased sophistication in use of HTML and mastery of other Web
concepts.</p>
