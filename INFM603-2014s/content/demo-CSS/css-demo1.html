<p style="font-family:arial; color:blue">I'm an associate professor in the iSchool at the University of Maryland. I joined the faculty in August 2004, shortly after completing my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, and was promoted to associate professor in March 2009. I also have appointments in the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) and the Department of Computer Science at Maryland.</p>
