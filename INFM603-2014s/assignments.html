<h2>Assignment 0 <small>due January 29</small></h2>

<p><b>Note</b>: This assignment is due <i>on</i> the first day of
classes, which means that you should have completed the assignment
prior to our first class meeting. Although this assignment will not be
graded, it is important that you complete it successfully on time to
avoid falling behind.</p>

<p>Assignments for this course will be "handed in" as web pages, and
in this assignment you'll create a homepage for INFM 603. You'll "hand
in" subsequent assignments by adding new pages linked from your
homepage.</p>

<p>If you've never created a website before, these instructions will
show you how to create and upload your first web page on your
TerpConnect account. Alternatively, if you already have a web site
elsewhere and would like that use that instead, feel free to do
so.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Download and
install <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> (latest
version is 2.0.2). An evaluation license to use the software is
free. This is the text editor we'll be using throughout the
semester. If you're already comfortable with some other text editor,
you're welcome to use that.</p></li>

<li><p>Create a file named <code>index.html</code> (all letters
lowercased) with the following contents:</p>

<pre style="margin-top: 10px;">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello world! I'm Jimmy. Welcome to my INFM 603 homepage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>Instead of my name, substitute your own!</p></li>

<li>You should be able to open up the file in a web browser and see a
very rudimentary webpage. Next, we're going to upload it to your
TerpConnect account.</p>

<li><p>Download one of following FTP clients, depending on your operating system:

<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?USER=&MRP=0&PROJECTID=1&MR=37759">Fetch</a> (Mac OS X)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?USER=&MRP=0&PROJECTID=1&MR=7807">WinSCP</a> (Windows)</li>

</ul>
</p>
</li>

<li><p>Now
follow <a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?PROJECTID=1&MR=115578">these
instructions</a> to upload <code>index.html</code> onto the
server. Put the file in the folder <code>/pub/USERID/INFM603/</code>
(where USERID is your Directory ID). Note that the directory probably
doesn't exist initially, so you'll have to create it. For additional
details,
see <a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?USER=&MRP=0&PROJECTID=1&MR=43278">this
page for Fetch (Mac OS X)</a>
and <a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?USER=&MRP=0&PROJECTID=1&MR=39841">this
page for WinSCP (Windows)</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p>If you've completed these steps successfully, you should be
able to navigate to your TerpConnect homepage for INFM
603: <a href="http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jimmylin/INFM603/"><code>http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jimmylin/INFM603/</code></a>. Obviously,
the URL for your homepage should have your Directory ID, not
mine.</p></p>

<li><p>To complete this assignment, send me an email with your name and
the URL of your INFM 603 homepage. Note that this URL will either be
of the form above (unless you've decided to host your page elsewhere,
which is fine also).</p></li>

<section id="assignment1" style="padding-top:35px">
<div>
<h2>Assignment 1 <small>due February 5</small></h2>

<p>"Turn in" this assignment by creating a new web page that contains
answers to these questions. This page should be linked from your
course homepage (the URL you gave me in Assignment 0).</p>

<p>Consider the specifications of a laptop that you might consider
buying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Processor: 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5</li>
  <li>Hard drive: 500 GB, random access time of 10 ms</li>
  <li>RAM: 4 GB, 100 ns access time</li>
  <li>Peripherals: DVD-RW</li>
</ul>

<p>Although we talked about modern processors having multiple cores,
for this assignment assume that all operations are performed by a
single core. To simplify calculations, you can assume that 1 megabyte
is 1,000,000 (one million) bytes, 1 gigabyte is 1,000,000,000 (one
billion) bytes, etc.</p>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>If you buy some 4.7 GB DVDs, how many would you need to back up
a full hard drive to DVDs (assuming no compression)? Do you think it's
convenient to back up your hard drive onto DVDs?</p></li>

<li><p>Now let's see how much stuff that hard drive can hold.  Assume
you have access to the following information for all 314 million
people in the United States:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Name: 40 characters</li>
<li>Phone Number: 10 characters</li>
<li>SSN: 9 characters</li>
<li>taxes owed: one four-byte number</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Assume that each character is stored in one byte.</p>

<p>Would all of these data fit on the hard drive of the laptop
described above? If not, how big a hard drive would you need? If so,
what fraction of the disk would this fill?</p>

</li>

<li><p>Now let's see how long it would take to read that much data off
the disk. Assume you have a hard drive large enough to store all the
data.</p>

<p>Suppose you wanted to add up the taxes owed by all 310 million
people. Assume that you access the data in a random order, and that
you start a new disk access for each person (in the specifications
above I have provided the latency of disk access). How long would it
take to access all the data?</p>

</li>

<li><p>Assume for the sake of comparison that all of this data could
fit in RAM.</p>

<p>How long would it take to access all the data from RAM (in the same
manner as above: reading data in a random order, one person at a
time)? In the specifications above I have provided the latency of RAM
access.</p>

</li>

<li><p>Which is faster, RAM or the hard disk? By how much?</p></li>

<li><p>Now let's see how long it would take to move the bits
around.</p>

<p>How long would it take to move the contents of your entire hard
drive to your friend's computer in California over a dial-up modem?
Over broadband? Overnight mail? Note that this question requires you
to figure out what the speeds of each of those techniques are. Cite
your sources.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p>When you are done, your course homepage (i.e., the link you sent me
in Assignment 0) should contain a link a page which has these
answers. There is nothing to explicitly turn in; I'll look at your
assignment directly over the web.</p>

<section id="assignment2" style="padding-top:35px">
<div>
<h2>Assignment 2 <small>due February 12</small></h2>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to exercise the HTML and CSS
skills learned in
class. On <a href="assignments/assignment2-template.html">this very
simple page</a> you'll find a list of red and white wines (Credit for
the wine descriptions goes
to <a href="http://www.totalwine.com/">Total Wine</a>). Build a simple
wine catalog website that contains that content. Your site should have
at least three inter-connected pages: a main page, a page for red
wines, and a page for white wines. These pages should contain all
information from the source page above, but you are welcome to add in
whatever additional content to "round out" the site. When you are
done, your course homepage (i.e., the link you sent me in Assignment
0) should contain a link to the main page of this wine catalog.

<p>Note that each wine comes with regular, structured data such as
type, price, image, description, etc. It is expected that you will use
appropriate markup to organize the data, such as tables, lists,
etc. It is also expected that you use CSS to control the style of
elements on your site. Your assignment will be graded in terms of
technical execution (e.g., use of appropriate HTML elements) as well
as esthetics (e.g., the overal flow of the site, organization of
material, etc.).</p>

<p>For extra credit, design the site
using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>,
which is the collection of HTML/CSS tools used for this course
website.</p>

<section id="assignment3" style="padding-top:35px">
<div>
<h2>Assignment 3 <small>due February 19</small></h2>

<p>Write the following two programs and post links to your solution on
your homepage. Each solution should be its own web page:</p>

<ol>

<li>Create a web page with a JavaScript program that computes the future
value of an initial investment that receives <i>x</i>% interest per
year after <i>n</i> years. Feel free to
use <a href="assignments/assignment3-template1.html">this template</a>
as a starting point (the page currently does not work, but it lets you
know where you should put your code). Wikipedia provides a refresher
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest">compound
interest</a>.</li>

<li>Create a web page with a JavaScript program that computes the
minimum number of years that an initial investment will at least
double at a particular interest rate per year. As with above, feel
free to use <a href="assignments/assignment3-template2.html">this
template</a>.</li>

</ol>

<p>Note that although it is possible to compute the answers directly,
you are <i>required</i> to use loops, as that is the point of the
exercise.</p>

<p><i>Hint:</i> We learned about two different types of loop
constructs in class. One provides a natural solution to one of the
questions; the other provides a natural solution to the other
question.</p>

</div>

<section id="assignment4" style="padding-top:35px">
<div>
<h2>Assignment 4 <small>due February 26</small></h2>

<p>In this assignment, you will start with the two pages you created
for assignment 3 and add to them. In addition to showing the final
answer (for part 1 and part 2), each page will also show a table with
the value of the investment over time.</p>

<p>For example, in part 1, if I set the interest rate to 7% and number
of years to 10, I should see something like this:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="width: 300px">
<tr><td><b>year</b></td><td><b>amount</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1070</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>1144.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>1225.0430000000001</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>1310.7960100000003</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>1402.5517307000005</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>1500.7303518490005</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>1605.7814764784307</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>1718.186179831921</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>1838.4592124201556</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>1967.1513572895667</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Your JavaScript program will have to manipulate the DOM and add
table rows programmatically. Note that if I enter a particular set of
values, and then another set of values, the table should only show
results from the most recent computation&mdash;this means that you
have to make sure the table is "cleared" before each computation
begins.</p>

<p>Note that although it is possible to compute the answers directly,
you are <i>required</i> to use loops, as that is the point of the
exercise.</p>

<section id="assignment5" style="padding-top:35px">
<div>
<h2>Assignment 5 <small>due March 5</small></h2>

<p>For this assignment, start with
the <a href="content/demo-js/wine-objects3.html">wine as objects (part
3) demo</a>. Modify the program in the following ways:</p>

<ol>

  <li>The demo only displays five wines. Add in content for all ten
 wines in <a href="assignments/assignment2-template.html">the template
 from assignment #2</a>. There is no need to include the wine
 description, e.g., "Elegant, Cherry, Raspberry, Medium-bodied..."</li>

  <li>The demo only displays the name of the wine and its price in the
  table. Modify the program so that it displays <i>all</i> of the
  object's properties (name, image, location, varietal, price). Note
  that the table should show the image of the wine. There is no need
  to include the description.</li>

  <li>The discount button currently discounts prices by $1.00 each
  time. Add a text box (note, <i>not</i> an alert box) where you can
  input how much to discount the wines by each time you click the
  button. Note that per the exercises in
  class, <code>discount()</code> should be a method of the object, not
  a function.</li>

  <li>Implement a button that is the exact opposite of the discount
  method: it raises prices of the wines. There should be a text box
  that allows the user to enter how much to raise prices by. This
  should be implemented as a method, not a function.</li>

  <li>Add some CSS to change the appearance of the page so it does not
  look so "plain".</li>

<h2>Assignment 6 <small>due March 12</small></h2>

<p>In this assignment you'll be working with a simple SQL database
engine called <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>. Download
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">SQLite
Manager</a>, which is an add-on to Firefox (so you'll need to get it
first if you haven't already).</p>

<p>We'll be working with the
database <a href="content/demo-db/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite">
Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite</a>, which is
the <a href="http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/">Chinook
Database</a> (version 1.4). You'll find
the <a href="http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Chinook_Schema&referringTitle=Home">database
schema</a> very helpful as you go about these exercises.</p>

<p>Open Firefox and start the SQLite Manager (under the Tools
menu). You should now be able to
open <code>Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite</code>, downloaded from
above.</p>

<p>For the assignment, answer the following questions. For each,
provide both the answer and the SQL statement you used to compute the
answer.</p>

<ol>

  <li>What's the total revenue (i.e., sum of all the invoices)?</li>

  <li>How much in total was <code>InvoiceId</code> 404? (Answer this
  question with the <code>Invoice</code> table)</li>

  <li>How much in total was <code>InvoiceId</code> 404? (Answer this
  question with <i>only</i> the <code>InvoiceLine</code> table)</li>

  <li>How many times did John Gordon make a purchase?</li>

  <li>Each time John Gordon made a purchase, on average how much does he spend?</li>

  <li>How much as John Gordon spent in total?</li>

  <li>What are the names of the songs that John Gordon has purchased?
  How many of them are there?</li>

  <li>How many employees are also customers?</li>

  <li>Who are the 5 top spenders (customers who have spent the most
  money) and how much have they each spent?</li>

<h2>Assignment 7 <small>due March 26</small></h2>


<p>In this assignment you'll be building on the Chinook PHP demo
application presented in class. Modify the application in the
following ways:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Currently, there is a functionality to search by
  artist. Searching by artist will return all the tracks by that
  artist and what album the track is from. Modify the PHP search
  script so that in addition to the artist, album, and track, the
  price is also displayed. Also, the search results should include the
  total cost of buying all the tracks in the list of results.</li>

  <li>Add the ability to search by track name. That is, the user
  should be able to enter a track name in a form, and a PHP script
  will return a results page containing all tracks with that name,
  with artist and album names.</li>

  <li>The current application interface looks very primitive. Redesign
  the overall site, making use of CSS so it doesn't look so
  "plain".</li>

</ul>

<p>To submit this assignment, your course homepage should contain a
link to your live web application.</p>

<section id="finalproject" style="padding-top:35px">
<div>
<h2>Final Project</h2>

<p>The final project is an open-ended assignment designed to
demonstrate your mastery of technologies introduced in class. You may
work individually or in teams of up to three people. However, my
expectations for the scope and complexity of the project will be
commensurate with the size of the group. In rough terms, I expect a
level of effort comparable to three homework assignments, multiplied
by the number of people in your group.</p>

<p>There are two aspects of the final project:</p>

<ul>

<li>The project must meet some <i>real need</i>. That is, it should be
useful for something, for someone, or for some purpose.</li>

<li>The project must substantively exercise many of the technologies
introduced in class. It is expected that you will engage in some
amount of self-learning beyond the material covered in lectures and
assignments.</li>

</ul>

<p>More details will be discussed in class and you will be given an
opportunity to ask questions.</p>

<p>Before the class session on April 9th, a project proposal will
be due, via email to me. The proposal should contain a few, succinct
paragraphs addressing the following:</p>

<ol>

  <li>stating who the project group members are, or if you're working
  alone;</li>

  <li>what the purpose of the project is (what problem are you trying
  to solve, who are you trying to help, etc.);</li>

  <li>what technologies you plan to use.</li>

</ol>

<p>Only one email per group is needed. I will provide feedback on the
appropriateness of the scope of the project and the use of
technology.</p>

<h3>Final Project Presentation</h3>

<p>The class session on May 7 will be devoted to
final project presentations.
Each group will be allotted a presentation slot
based on the number of group members: 10 minutes if you are working by
yourself and 15 minutes for a team of two or three.
How you decide to use the presentation time is completely up to
you, but my recommendation would be to start with a (short)
presentation using slides to set up the context, and then provide a
demo of your project. Some of the topics that would be appropriate to
cover in your presentation (either in slides or as part of the demo)
might be:</p>

<ul>

  <li>What is the purpose of the project? What does it do? Who is it
  intended for?</li>

  <li>Overview of the architecture, for example, the data model if
  you're using SQL.</li>

  <li>Overview of key features.</li>

  <li>Any lessons learned in building the project: Was there something
  you would have done differently? What worked particularly well? No
  so well?</li>

</ul>

<p>Please arrive a few minutes early to class to test out the
projector.</p>

<h3>Project Grading</h3>

<p>The deliverable for the final project is an email (one from each
group) containing the following information:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Slides used during the presentation (if any).</li>

  <li>URL for the project, along with any instructions, e.g., how to
  log in (if applicable), a feature you want to highlight, etc. Please
  note that the project must remain operational until at least the end
  of the semester so I can explore its functionality.</li>

</ul>

<p>The email containing this information is due on the day of your
presentation session.</p>

<p>The final project grade will consist of the following
components:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Technology</b> (6 points): Does the project demonstrate
appropriate use of technology?</li>

<li><b>Design</b> (3 point): Does the project demonstrate good visual
design?</li>

<li><b>Content</b> (3 points): Does the project contain an appropriate
amount of content?</li>

<li><b>Presentation</b> (3 points): Does the presentation clearly
provide an overview of the project?</li>

</ul>

<p>All the component scores sum to 15 points. The final project will
be worth 35% of your course grade.</p>
