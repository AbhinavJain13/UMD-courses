<h2>Assignment 0 <small>due September 6, 2012</small></h2>

<p><b>Note</b>: This assignment is due <i>on</i> the first day of
classes, which means that you should have completed the assignment
prior to our first class meeting. Although this assignment will not be
graded, it is important that you complete it successfully on time to
avoid falling behind.</p>

<p>Assignments for this course will be "handed in" as web pages, and
in this assignment you'll create a homepage for INFM 603. You'll "hand
in" subsequent assignments by adding new pages linked from your
homepage.</p>

<p>If you've never created a website before, these instructions will
show you how to create and upload your first web page on your
TerpConnect account. Alternatively, if you already have a web site
elsewhere and would like that use that instead, feel free to do
so.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Download and
install <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. An
evaluation license to use the software is free. This is the text
editor we'll be using throughout the semester. If you're already
comfortable with some other text editor, you're welcome to use
that.</p></li>

<li><p>Create a file named <code>index.html</code> (all letters
lowercased) with the following contents:</p>

<pre style="margin-top: 10px;">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello world! I'm Jimmy. Welcome to my INFM 603 homepage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>Instead of my name, substitute your own!</p></li>

<li>You should be able to open up the file in a web browser and see a
very rudimentary webpage. Next, we're going to upload it to your
TerpConnect account.</p>

<li><p>Download one of following FTP clients, depending on your operating system:

<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?PROJECTID=1&MR=37793">Fugu</a> (Mac OS X)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?PROJECTID=1&MR=7807">WinSCP</a> (Windows)</li>

</ul>
</p>
</li>

<li><p>Now
follow <a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?PROJECTID=1&MR=115578">these
instructions</a> to upload <code>index.html</code> onto the
server. Put the file in the folder <code>/pub/USERID/INFM603/</code>
(where USERID is your Directory ID). Note that the directory probably
doesn't exist initially, so you'll have to create it. For additional
details,
see <a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?USER=&MRP=0&PROJECTID=1&MR=37801">this
page for Fugu (Mac OS X)</a>
and <a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?USER=&MRP=0&PROJECTID=1&MR=39841">this
page for WinSCP (Windows)</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p>If you've completed these steps successfully, you should be
able to navigate to your TerpConnect homepage for INFM
603: <a href="http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jimmylin/INFM603/"><code>http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jimmylin/INFM603/</code></a>. Obviously,
the URL for your homepage should have your Directory ID, not
mine.</p></p>

<li><p>To complete this assignment, send me an email with your name and
the URL of your INFM 603 homepage. Note that this URL will either be
of the form above (unless you've decided to host your page elsewhere,
which is fine also).</p></li>

</ol>

<section id="assignment1">
<div>
<h2>Assignment 1 <small>due September 13, 2012</small></h2>

<p>"Hand in" this assignment by creating a new web page that contains
answers to the below questions, which should be linked from the main
page (the URL you gave me in Assignment 0).</p>

<p>Consider the specifications of a laptop that you might consider
buying:</p>

<blockquote>
Processor: 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5<br/>
Hard drive: 500 GB, random access time of 10 ms<br/>
RAM: 4 GB, 100 ns access time<br/>
Peripherals: DVD-RW<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>Although we talked about modern processors having multiple cores,
for this assignment assume that all operations are performed by a
single core. To simplify calculations, you can assume that 1 megabyte
is 1,000,000 (one million) bytes, 1 gigabyte is 1,000,000,000 (one
billion) bytes, etc.</p>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>If you buy some 4.7 GB DVDs, how many would you need to back up
a full hard drive to DVDs (assuming no compression)?</p></li>

<li><p>Now let's see how much stuff that hard drive can hold.  Assume
you have access to the following information for all 310 million
people in the United States:</p>

<blockquote>
Name: 40 characters<br/>
Phone Number: 10 characters<br/>
SSN: 9 characters<br/>
taxes owed: one four-byte number<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>Assume that each character is stored in one byte.</p>

<p>Would all of these data fit on the hard drive of the laptop
described above? If not, how big a hard drive would you need? If so,
what fraction of the disk would this fill?</p>

</li>

<li><p>Now let's see how long it would take to read that much data off
the disk. Assume you have a hard drive large enough to store all the
data.</p>

<p>Suppose you wanted to add up the taxes owed by all 310 million
people. Assume that you access the data in a random order, and that
you start a new disk access for each person (in the specifications
above I have provided the latency of disk access). How long would it
take to access all the data?</p>

</li>

<li><p>Assume for the sake of comparison that all of this data could
fit in RAM.</p>

<p>How long would it take to access all the data from RAM (in the same
manner as above: reading data in a random order, one person at a
time)? In the specifications above I have provided the latency of RAM
access.</p>

</li>

<li><p>Which is faster, RAM or the hard disk? By how much?</p></li>

<li><p>Now let's see how long it would take to move the bits
around.</p>

<p>How long would it take to move the contents of your entire hard
drive to your friend's computer in California over a dial-up modem?
Over broadband? Overnight mail? Note that this question requires you
to figure out what the speeds of each of those techniques are. Cite
your sources.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p>When you are done, your course homepage (i.e., the link you sent me
in Assignment 0) should contain a link a page which has these
answers. There is nothing to explicitly turn in; I'll look at your
assignment directly over the web.</p>

</div>

<section id="assignment2">
<div>
<h2>Assignment 2 <small>due September 20, 2012</small></h2>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to exercise the HTML and CSS
skills learned in
class. On <a href="assignments/assignment2-template.html">this very
simple page</a> you'll find a list of red and white wines (Credit for
the wine descriptions goes
to <a href="http://www.totalwine.com/">Total Wine</a>). Build a simple
wine catalog website that contains that content. Your site should have
at least three inter-connected pages: a main page, a page for red
wines, and a page for white wines. These pages should contain all
information from the source page above, but you are welcome to add in
whatever additional content to "round out" the site. When you are
done, your course homepage (i.e., the link you sent me in Assignment
0) should contain a link to the main page of this wine catalog.

<p>Note that each wine comes with regular, structured data such as
type, price, image, description, etc. It is expected that you will use
appropriate markup to organize the data, such as tables, lists,
etc. It is also expected that you use CSS to control the style of
elements on your site. Your assignment will be graded in terms of
technical execution (e.g., use of appropriate HTML elements) as well
as esthetics (e.g., the overal flow of the site, organization of
material, etc.).</p>

<p>For extra credit, design the site
using <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">Bootstrap</a>,
which is the collection of HTML/CSS tools used for this course
website.</p>

<section id="assignment3">
<div>
<h2>Assignment 3 <small>due September 27, 2012</small></h2>

<p>Write the following two programs and post links to your solution on
your homepage. Each solution should be its own web page:</p>

<ol>

<li>Create a web page with a Javascript program that computes the future
value of an initial investment that receives <i>x</i>% interest per
year after <i>n</i> years. Feel free to
use <a href="assignments/assignment3-template1.html">this template</a>
as a starting point (the page currently does not work, but it lets you
know where you should put your code). Wikipedia provides a refresher
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest">compound
interest</a>.</li>

<li>Create a web page with a Javascript program that computes the
minimum number of years that an initial investment will at least
double at a particular interest rate per year. As with above, feel
free to use <a href="assignments/assignment3-template2.html">this
template</a>.</li>

</ol>

<p><i>Hint:</i> We learned about two different types of loop
constructs in class. One provides a natural solution to one of the
questions; the other provides a natural solution to the other
question.</p>
