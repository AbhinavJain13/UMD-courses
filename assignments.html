<h3>Assignment 0: Prelude <small>due January 24</small></h3>

<p>Complete
the <a href="http://lintool.github.com/Cloud9/docs/word-count.html">word
count tutorial</a> in Cloud<sup>9</sup>, which is a Hadoop toolkit we're
going to use throughout the course. The tutorial will take you
through setting up Hadoop on your local machine and running Hadoop on
the virtual machine. It'll also begin familiarizing you with
github.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This assignment is not explictly graded, except as
part of Assignment 1.</p>

<section id="assignment1" style="padding-top:35px">
<div>
<h3>Assignment 1: Warmup <small>due January 31</small></h3>

<p>Make sure you've completed
the <a href="http://lintool.github.com/Cloud9/docs/word-count.html">word
count tutorial</a> in Cloud<sup>9</sup>.</p>

<p>Sign up for a <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> account. It is
very important that you do so as soon as possible, because GitHub is
the mechanism by which you will submit assignments. Once you've signed
up for an account, go to this page
to <a href="https://github.com/edu">request an educational
account</a>.</p>

<p>Next, create a <b>private</b> repo
called <code>MapReduce-assignments</code>. Here
is <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo">how you
create a repo on GitHub</a>. For "Who has access to this repository?",
make sure you click "Only the people I specify". If you've
successfully gotten an educational account (per above), you should be
able to create private repos for free. Take some time to learn about
git if you've never used it before. There are plenty of good tutorials
online: do a simple web search and find one you like. If you've used
svn before, many of the concepts will be familiar, except that git
is far more powerful.</p>

<p>After you've learned about git, set aside the repo for now; you'll
come back to it later.</p>

<p>In the single node virtual cluster in the word count tutorial, you
should have run the word count demo with five reducers:</p>

<pre>
etc/hadoop-cluster.sh edu.umd.cloud9.example.simple.DemoWordCount \
  -input bible+shakes.nopunc.gz -output wc -numReducers 5
</pre>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>

<p><b>Question 1.</b> What is the first term
in <code>part-r-00000</code> and how many times does it appear?</p>

<p><b>Question 2.</b> What is the third to last term
in <code>part-r-00004</code> and how many times does it appear?</p>

<p><b>Question 3.</b> How many unique terms are there? (Hint: read the
counter values)</p>

<p>Let's do a little bit of cleanup of the words. Modify the word
count demo so that only words consisting entirely of letters are
counted. To be more specific, the word must match the following Java
regular expression:</p>

<pre>
word.matches("[A-Za-z]+")
</pre>

<p>Now run word count again, also with five reducers. Answer the
following questions:</p>

<p><b>Question 4.</b> What is the first term
in <code>part-r-00000</code> and how many times does it appear?</p>

<p><b>Question 5.</b> What is the third to last term
in <code>part-r-00004</code> and how many times does it appear?</p>

<p><b>Question 6.</b> How many unique terms are there?

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Turning in the Assignment</h4>

<p>Please follow these instructions carefully!</p>

<p>Per above, you should have a private github repo called
<code>MapReduce-assignments</code>. Inside the repo, create a
directory called <code>assignment1</code>; in that directory, create a
file called <code>assignment1.md</code>. In that file, put your
answers to the above questions 1 through 6. Use the Markdown
annotation format: here's
a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">simple
guide</a>. Here's an <a href="http://markable.in/editor/">online
editor</a> that's also helpful.</p>

<p>Create a directory called <code>assignment1/src/</code> and
put your source code in there (i.e., the modified word count
demo).</p>

<p>Next, in the directory <code>assignment1/</code>, create a shell
script called <code>run-assignment1.sh</code>, which when executed
will run the code that answers questions 4 through 6 (i.e., modified
word count). When I check out your repo in my copy of the virtual
machine, I should be able to execute that script to run your code.</p>

<p>You can assume, just like in the the word count tutorial, that the
input file is already in HDFS
as <code>bible+shakes.nopunc.gz</code>. Your script should put the
word count output in a directory that is the same as your GitHub
username. Please don't name the output directory <code>output/</code>
or something generic.

<p>However you structure your repo to make the script work is up to
you. My recommendation would be to check in compiled jars into the
repo and then have <code>run-assignment1.sh</code> execute the
appropriate hadoop command, but working out these details is part of the
assignment.</p>

<p>In summary, there are three deliverables to this homework:</p>

<ul>

  <li><code>MapReduce-assignments/assignment1/assignment1.md</code>: actual answers to questions.</li>
  <li><code>MapReduce-assignments/assignment1/src/</code>: source code goes into this directory.</li>
  <li><code>MapReduce-assignments/assignment1/run-assignment1.sh</code>: run script.</li>

</ul>

<p>Make sure you've committed your code and pushed your repo back to
origin. You can verify that it's there by logging into your GitHub
account, and your assignment should be viewable in the web
interface.</p>

<p>Almost there! Add the
user <a href="https://github.com/teachtool">teachtool</a> a
collaborator to your repo so that I can check it out (under settings
in the main web interface on the top right corner of your repo). Note:
do <b>not</b> add my primary GitHub
account <a href="https://github.com/lintool">lintool</a> as a
collaborator.</p>

<p>Finally, send me an email, to jimmylin@umd.edu with the subject
line "MapReduce Assignment #1". In the body of the email message, tell
me what your GitHub username is so that I can link your repo to
you. Also, in your email please tell me how long you spent doing the
assignment, including everything (installing the VM, learning about
git, working through the tutorial, etc.).</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Grading</h4>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with the
Hadoop development environment. You'll get a "pass" if you've
successfully completed the assignment. I expect everyone to get a
"pass".</p>
