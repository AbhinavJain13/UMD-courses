<h3>Assignment 0: Prelude <small>due 6:00pm January 26</small></h3>

<p>Note that this course requires you to have access to a reasonable
recent computer with at least 4 GB memory and plenty of hard disk
space.</p>

<p>Complete
the <a href="http://lintool.github.com/Cloud9/docs/word-count.html">word
count tutorial</a> in Cloud<sup>9</sup>, which is a Hadoop toolkit we're
going to use throughout the course. The tutorial will take you
through setting up Hadoop on your local machine and running Hadoop on
the virtual machine. It'll also begin familiarizing you with
GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This assignment is not explicitly graded, except as
part of Assignment 1.</p>

<section id="assignment1" style="padding-top:35px">
<div>
<h3>Assignment 1: Warmup <small>due 6:00pm February 2</small></h3>

<p>Make sure you've completed
the <a href="http://lintool.github.com/Cloud9/docs/word-count.html">word
count tutorial</a> in Cloud<sup>9</sup>.</p>

<p>Sign up for a <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> account. It is
very important that you do so as soon as possible, because GitHub is
the mechanism by which you will submit assignments. Once you've signed
up for an account, go to this page
to <a href="https://github.com/edu">request an educational
account</a>.</p>

<p>Next, create a <b>private</b> repo
called <code>bigdata-assignments</code>. Here
is <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo">how you
create a repo on GitHub</a>. For "Who has access to this repository?",
make sure you click "Only the people I specify". If you've
successfully gotten an educational account (per above), you should be
able to create private repos for free. Take some time to learn about
git if you've never used it before. There are plenty of good tutorials
online: do a simple web search and find one you like. If you've used
svn before, many of the concepts will be familiar, except that git
is far more powerful.</p>

<p>After you've learned about git, set aside the repo for now; you'll
come back to it later.</p>

<p>In the single node virtual cluster in the word count tutorial, you
should have already ran the word count demo with five reducers:</p>

<pre>
$ hadoop jar target/cloud9-X.Y.Z-fatjar.jar edu.umd.cloud9.example.simple.DemoWordCount \
   -input bible+shakes.nopunc -output wc -numReducers 5
</pre>

<p>Answer the following questions (see instructions below for how to "turn in" these answers):</p>

<p><b>Question 1.</b> What is the first term
in <code>part-r-00000</code> and how many times does it appear?</p>

<p><b>Question 2.</b> What is the third to last term
in <code>part-r-00004</code> and how many times does it appear?</p>

<p><b>Question 3.</b> How many unique terms are there? (Hint: read the
counter values)</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Time to write some code!</h4>

<p>Per above, you should have a private GitHub repo called
<code>bigdata-assignments/</code>. Change into that directory. Once
inside, create a Maven project with the following command:</p>

<pre>
$ mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=edu.umd.YOUR_USERNAME -DartifactId=assignment1
</pre>

<p>For <code>YOUR_USERNAME</code>, please use your GitHub username
(not your UMD directory ID, not your email address, or anything
else...). In what follows below, I will use
<code>jimmylin</code>, but you should obviously substitute your
own. Once you've executed the above command you should be able
to <code>cd</code>
into <code>bigdata-assignments/assignment1</code>. In that directory,
you'll find a <code>pom.xml</code> file (which tells Maven how to
build your code); replace with this
one <a href="assignments/pom.xml">here</a> (which is set up properly
for Hadoop), but inside this <code>pom.xml</code>, change the
following line and replace my username with yours.</p>

<pre>
  &lt;groupId&gt;edu.umd.jimmylin&lt;/groupId&gt;
</pre>

<p>Next,
copy <code>Cloud9/src/main/java/edu/umd/cloud9/example/simple/DemoWordCount.java</code>
into <code>bigdata-assignments/assignment1/src/main/java/edu/umd/jimmylin/</code>. Open
up this new version of <code>DemoWordCount.java</code>
in <code>assignment1/</code> using a text editor and change the Java
package to <code>edu.umd.jimmylin</code>.</p>

<p>Now, in the <code>bigdata-assignments/assignment1</code> base
directory, you should be able to run Maven to build your package:</p>

<pre>
$ mvn clean package
</pre>

<p>Once the build succeeds, you should be able to run the word count
demo program in your own repository:</p>

<pre>
$ hadoop jar target/cloud9-X.Y.Z-fatjar.jar edu.umd.jimmylin.DemoWordCount \
   -input bible+shakes.nopunc -output wc -numReducers 5
</pre>

<p>The output should be exactly the same as the program above, but the
difference here is that the code is now in a repository under your
control. Congratulations, you've created your first functional Maven
artifact!<p>

<p>Let's do a little bit of cleanup of the words. Modify the word
count demo (your newly-created version in <code>assignment1/</code>)
so that only words consisting entirely of letters are counted. To be
more specific, the word must match the following Java regular
expression:</p>

<pre>
word.matches("[A-Za-z]+")
</pre>

<p>Now run this modified word count, again with five reducers. Answer
the following questions:</p>

<p><b>Question 4.</b> What is the first term
in <code>part-r-00000</code> and how many times does it appear?</p>

<p><b>Question 5.</b> What is the third to last term
in <code>part-r-00004</code> and how many times does it appear?</p>

<p><b>Question 6.</b> How many unique terms are there?

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Turning in the Assignment</h4>

<p>Please follow these instructions carefully!</p>

<p>At this point, you should have a GitHub
repo <code>bigdata-assignments</code>, and inside the repo, you should
have a directory
called <code>assignment1/</code>. Under <code>assignment1/</code>, you
should already have the code for the modified word count example above
(i.e., questions 4, 5, 6). Commit all of this code and push to
GitHub.</p>

<p>Next, under <code>assignment1/</code>, create a file
called <code>assignment1.md</code>. In that file, put your answers to
the above questions 1 through 6. Use the Markdown annotation format:
here's
a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">simple
guide</a>. Here's an <a href="http://markable.in/editor/">online
editor</a> that's also helpful.</p>

<p>Make sure you have committed everything and have pushed your repo
back to origin. You can verify that it's there by logging into your
GitHub account (in a web browser): your assignment should be
viewable in the web interface.</p>

<p>Almost there! Add the
user <a href="https://github.com/teachtool">teachtool</a> a
collaborator to your repo so that I can check it out (under settings
in the main web interface on your repo). Note: do <b>not</b> add my
primary GitHub
account <a href="https://github.com/lintool">lintool</a> as a
collaborator.</p>

<p>Finally, send me an email, to jimmylin@umd.edu with the subject
line "Big Data Infrastructure Assignment #1". In the body of the email
message, tell me what your GitHub username is so that I can link your
repo to you. Also, in your email please tell me how long you spent
doing the assignment, including everything (installing the VM,
learning about git, working through the tutorial, etc.).</p>


<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Grading</h4>

<p>Here's how I am going to grade your assignment. I will clone your
repo, go into your <code>assignment1/</code> directory, and build your
Maven artifact:</p>

<pre>
$ mvn clean package
</pre>

<p>I am then going to run your code:</p>

<pre>
$ hadoop jar target/cloud9-X.Y.Z-fatjar.jar edu.umd.jimmylin.DemoWordCount \
   -input bible+shakes.nopunc -output wc -numReducers 5
</pre>

<p>Once the code completes, I will verify its output. To make sure
everything is in the proper place, you should do a fresh clone, i.e.,
clone your own repo, but in a different location, and run through
these same steps. If it works for you, it'll work for me.</p>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with the
Hadoop development environment. You'll get a "pass" if you've
successfully completed the assignment. I expect everyone to get a
"pass".</p>
