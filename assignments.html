<h2>Assignment 0 <small>due September 6, 2012</small></h2>

<p><b>Note</b>: This assignment is due <i>on</i> the first day of
classes, which means that you should have completed the assignment
prior to our first class meeting. Although this assignment will not be
graded, it is important that you complete it successfully on time to
avoid falling behind.</p>

<p>Assignments for this course will be "handed in" as web pages, and
in this assignment you'll create a homepage for INFM 603. You'll "hand
in" subsequent 

If you've
never created a website before, these instructions will show you how
to create and upload your first web page on your TerpConnect
account. Alternatively, if you already have a web site elsewhere and
would like that use that instead,

<ol>

<li><p>Download and
install <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. An
evaluation license to use the software is free. This is the text
editor we'll be using throughout the semester. If you're already
comfortable with some other text editor, you're welcome to use
that.</p></li>

<li><p>Create a file named <code>index.html</code> (all letters
lowercased) with the following contents:</p>

<pre style="margin-top: 10px;">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello world! I'm Jimmy. Welcome to my INFM 603 homepage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>Instead of my name, substitute your own!</p></li>

<li>You should be able to open up the file in a web browser and see a
very rudimentary webpage. Next, we're going to upload it to your
TerpConnect account.</p>

<li><p>Download one of following FTP clients, depending on your operating system:

<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?PROJECTID=1&MR=37793">Fugu</a> (Mac OS X)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?PROJECTID=1&MR=7807">WinSCP</a> (Windows)</li>

</ul>
</p>
</li>

<li><p>Now
follow <a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?PROJECTID=1&MR=115578">these
instructions</a> to upload <code>index.html</code> onto the
server. Put the file in the folder <code>/pub/USERID/INFM603/</code>
(where USERID is your Directory ID). Note that the directory probably
doesn't exist initially, so you'll have to create it. For additional
details,
see <a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?USER=&MRP=0&PROJECTID=1&MR=37801">this
page for Fugu (Mac OS X)</a>
and <a href="https://www.itsc.umd.edu/MRcgi/MRTicketPage.pl?USER=&MRP=0&PROJECTID=1&MR=39841">this
page for WinSCP (Windows)</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p>If you've completed these steps successfully, you should be
able to navigate to your TerpConnect homepage for INFM
603: <a href="http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jimmylin/INFM603/"><code>http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jimmylin/INFM603/</code></a>. Obviously,
the URL for your homepage should have your Directory ID, not
mine.</p></p>

<li><p>To complete this assignment, send me an email with your name and
the URL of your INFM 603 homepage. Note that this URL will either be
of the form above (unless you've decided to host your page elsewhere,
which is fine also).</p></li>

<h2>Assignment 1 <small>due September 13, 2012</small></h2>

<p>This assignment is due before class on 9/17.  To turn in your
assignment, send me an email with the subject "LBSC 690 assignment
#1".  In the message body, either type your answers to attach a
document that contains the answer.  Show your work, as it will provide
an opportunity to receive partial credit.</p>

<p>Consider the specifications of a computer system that you might
consider buying:</p>

<blockquote>
Processor type: Intel Core 2 Duo<br/>
Processor speed: 2.5 GHz<br/>
Hard drive: 200 GB, 10 ms access time<br/>
RAM: 2 GB, 50 ns access time<br/>
Peripherals: DVD-RW<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>Although we talked about modern processors having multiple "cores",
for this assignment assume that all operations are performed by a
single core.  To simplify calculations, you can assume that 1 megabyte
is 1,000,000 (one million) bytes, 1 gigabyte is 1,000,000,000 (one
billion) bytes, etc.</p>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>If you buy some 4.7 GB DVDs, how many would you need to back up
a full hard drive to DVDs (assuming no compression)?  At 30 cents per
DVD, how much would a full backup cost?  At 10 minutes per DVD, how
long would a full backup take?</p></li>

<li><p>Now let's see how much stuff that hard drive can hold.  Assume
you have access to the following information for all 300 million
people in the United States:</p>

<blockquote>
Name: 40 characters<br/>
Phone Number: 10 characters<br/>
SSN: 9 characters<br/>
taxes owed: one four-byte number<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>Assume that each character is stored in one byte.</p>

<p>Would all of these data fit on the hard drive of the computer
described above?  If not, how big a hard drive would you need?  If so,
what fraction of the disk would this fill?</p>

</li>

<li><p>Now let's see how long it would take to read that much data off the
disk.  Assume you have a hard drive large enough to store all the
data.</p>

<p>Suppose you wanted to add up the taxes owed by all 300 million
people.  Assume that you access the data in a random order, and that
you start a new disk access for each person (in the specifications
above I have provided the latency of disk access).  How long would it
take to access all the data?  Could this be done in a second?  In a
minute?  In an hour?  In a day?  In a month?  In a year?</p>

</li>

<li><p>Assume for the sake of comparison that all of this data could fit
in RAM.</p>

<p>How long would it take to access all the data from RAM?  In the
specifications above I have provided the latency of RAM access. Could
this be done in a second?  In a minute?  In an hour?  In a day?  In a
month?  In a year?</p>

</li>

<li><p>Which is faster, RAM or the hard disk?</p></li>

<li><p>Now let's see how long it would take to move the bits around.</p>

<p>How long would it take to move the contents of your entire hard
drive to your friend's computer in California over a modem?  Over DSL?
Over a dedicated T1 line?  Overnight mail?</p>

</li>

<ol>

<li>
Create a Web page with a Javascript program that computes the future value of an investment that receives x% interest per year, where x is a nonnegative integer entered by the user. The program should ensure that a non-negative integer is entered, and it should print out the future value for each of the next 10 years. You can assume that the investment's initial value is $10,000 (or any other reasonable value) or you can also ask the user to input an initial investment amount -- either way would be fine.  <a href="assignments/assignment3-template1.html">starting point</a>.</li>
