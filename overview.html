<h2>Contact Information</h2>

<p>If you're interested in what I work on, here is
<a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/">my homepage</a>. The
best way to get in touch with me is via email, at  <script type="text/javascript">
			<!--
			emailE1=('jimmylin');
			emailE2=('umd.edu');
			document.write(emailE1 + '@' + emailE2)
			//--> 
</script>. I am available by appointment to discuss material from
class, the readings, homework assignments, the project, etc.  Email is
the best way to reach me to set up an appointment, and it's also a
good way to get a quick answer to a simple question.  </p>

<h2>Enrollment Policy</h2>

<p>This is a core course in the MIM program. If you're enrolled in
another program, you should consult with me to determine whether it
would be appropriate for you to take this course. If you've completed
LBSC 690, you may not register for INFM 603.</p>

<p>If you're a MIM student and you're already familiar with the
material covered in this course, you may request to instead take an
additional advanced technology course. Such requests are made using
the College's process for waiver of a requirement, which is described
in
the <a href="http://ischool.umd.edu/content/student-handbooks">Master's
Student Handbook</a>. You're advised to attend class and complete
class requirements until being notified that a waiver has been
approved.</p>

<h2>Course Materials</h2>

<p>The most recent version of all materials for the course will be
posted on this website, including the syllabus, readings, slides used
in class, and homework assignments. Please check the site frequently
for updates.</p>

<p>The principal textbooks for this course are:</p>

<table class="table">
<tbody>
<tr><td>Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML</td>
<td><a href="http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/" class="btn btn-small btn-primary">Book website</a>
<a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/059610197X" class="btn btn-small btn-inverse">Online version (1st Ed.)</a>
<a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9781449324469" class="btn btn-small btn-inverse">Online version (2nd Ed.)</a>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>Head First HTML5 Programming</td>
<td><a href="http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml5prog/" class="btn btn-small btn-primary">Book website</a>
<a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/web-design-and-development/9781449314712" class="btn btn-small btn-inverse">Online version</a></td></tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p><b>Note:</b/> "Head First HTML" is transitioning from the first to
the second edition as the semester begins. The release date of the
second edition is late August/early September, so there may be a time
period when both can be purchased. Either edition is fine, and in fact
you can find both versions online (see above). When assigning
readings, differences between the two editions will be pointed out.</p>

<p>Readings from other sources will be assigned as appropriate.</p>

<p>University of Maryland students have free access to the books above
via Safari Books Online (click the "Online version" links above), but
you may wish to purchase paper copies for convenience. Any online
bookseller will have these books. Note that examples from both books
are available for download from the book website links above.</p>

<p>You're encouraged to use the course mailing list to share
information that would be of general interest or for any other purpose
that seems reasonable. Mail sent to that address will reach me and all
students. If you have not received a message from the mailing list
yet, please contact me to make sure that your correct address is
included.</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>Components of the final grade are as follows:</p>

<table class="table table-striped">
<thead>
<tr><td><b>Component</b></td><td><b>Weight</b></td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr><td>Assignments</td>         <td>35% (5% each for 7 assignments)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final Project</td>       <td>35%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final Exam</td>          <td>30%</td></tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>The homework assignments are designed to provide an opportunity for
you to explore specific topics in a structured way. You may work
together on the homework assignments, but all of the material that is
turned in for grading must be produced individually. For example, you
may form study groups and work out homework solutions together on a
chalkboard or by each working separately on different terminals and
then sharing what you've learned, but it would not be permissible for
someone to prepare an answer set and then for others to copy those
answers and submit it as their own work. Turning in copied files is
specifically prohibited; you <b>must</b> individually write (type) any
material that is submitted for grading, including computer
programs.</p>

<p>Assignments are due before the class indicated on
the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>. A plus/check/minus/zero
system will be used for grading the homework assignments. Check
indicates a satisfactory completion of the assignment. Plus indicates
an impressive mastery of the material. Minus indicates noticeable gaps
in the product. Zero indicates failure to complete the
assignment.</p>

<p><i>Late policy:</i> For assignments turned in 24 hours late (or
less), I will take your original grade and bump it down a step
(e.g., plus becomes check, check becomes minus, etc.). For assignments
turned in more than 24 hours late but less than 48 hours late, I will
take your original grade and bump it down two steps, and so on.</p>

<p>The course will include a final group project. More details can be
found at <a href="assignments.html#finalproject">here</a>. In
addition, there will be a final exam for the course.</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>The University of Maryland, College Park has a nationally recognized
Code of Academic Integrity, administered by the Student Honor
Council. This Code sets standards for academic integrity at Maryland
for all undergraduate and graduate students. As a student you are
responsible for upholding these standards for this course. It is very
important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the
Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit
<a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu">http://www.shc.umd.edu</a>.</p>


<h2>Class Attendance</h2>

<p>This is a graduate course in which <i>you</i> are responsible for
making your own decisions regarding how best to master the material.
You will be held accountable for all content covered in class, in the
assigned readings, and in assignments. Experience strongly suggests
that you should attend classes. Class attendance for the final
project presentations (December 6) is required.

<h3>Accommodations for Religious Holidays and Other Special
Circumstances</h3>

<p>Students wishing to discuss accommodations for religious holidays
on dates that assignments are due, or other circumstances not
addressed in this course information page, should discuss those
circumstances with me <u>before</u> the third class session in order
to permit adequate time for planning. Only accommodations for
unforeseeable circumstances will be considered after that date.</p>

<h3>Accommodations for Disabilities</h3>

<p>The University is legally obligated to provide appropriate
accommodations for students with documented disabilities.
Accommodations will be made only in accordance with University policy.
Students who are entitled to accommodations due to disabilities must
first set up an appointment with
the <a href="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/DSS/">Disability Support
Services (DSS)</a>. To permit adequate planning, this process must be
completed and I must be notified <b>by DSS</b> at least two weeks
before the session in which the accommodation is required.</p>
