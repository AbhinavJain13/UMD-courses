<h2>Contact Information</h2>

This course is taught
by <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/">Jimmy Lin</a>; the
best to get in touch with me is via email, at  <script type="text/javascript">
			<!--
			emailE1=('jimmylin');
			emailE2=('umd.edu');
			document.write(emailE1 + '@' + emailE2)
			//--> 
</script>. I am available by appointment to discuss material from
class, the readings, homework assignments, the project, etc.  Email is
the best way to reach me to set up an appointment, and it is also a
good way to get a quick answer to a simple question.  </p>

<h3>Enrollment Policy</h3>

<p>This is a core course in the MIM program. Students enrolled in
other programs (including iSchool Ph.D. students) should consult with
the instructor to determine whether their academic preparation is
appropriate for this course. Students who have completed LBSC 690 may
not register for INFM 603.</p>

<p>MIM students who believe that their background has adequately
prepared them in terms of the the knowledge and experience that would
be gained in this course may request to instead take an additional
advanced technology course that better matches their needs. Such
requests are made using the College's process for waiver of a
requirement, which is described in
the <a href="http://ischool.umd.edu/content/student-handbooks">Master's
Student Handbook</a>. Students are advised to attend class and
complete class requirements until being notified that a waiver has
been approved.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<ul>

<li> Demonstrate mastery of foundational technologies for networked
     information management.

<li> Understand how these technologies are deployed in an
     organizational context.

</ul>

<h3> Approach </h3>

<p>
The first eight weeks of the class are designed to build a
progressively richer understanding of how specific foundational
capabilities (physical infrastructure, content representation,
structural markup, programming, and service-oriented architecture) are
used together to both process information and create the user
experience.  Homework assignments will be used to demonstrate mastery
of specific technologies.  In the second half of the course, class
sessions will be devoted to more holistic consideration of how those
capabilities are used together to support the activities of an
organization.  During this part of the semester, students will
complete a term project in which they demonstrate mastery of the
integrated use of technologies that were mastered individually during
the first half of the semester.  By examining technologies first
individually and then more holistically, students will have the
opportunity to enrich their understanding of how specific technologies
interact to help achieve the objectives of an organization.
</p>

<p>

<p>A <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> that summarizes what we will
cover each week can be found on the <a href="index.html">class Web
site</a>.  There are no scheduled lab sessions.</p>


<h3> Course Materials </h3>

<p>The class Web site at <a
href="index.html">http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~oard/teaching/603/fall11/</a>
contains the most recent version of all material produced for this
course.  Among other things, this course description, the syllabus,
the reading list, slides used in class, and homework assignments can
be found there.</p>

<p>
Textbook and supplemental reading assignments for each week can be
found on the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  The principal text
for this course is P.J. Deitel and H.M. Deitel, <a
href="http://www.deitel.com/Books/InternetWebScripting/InternetWorldWideWebHowtoProgram4e/tabid/2048/Default.aspx">Internet
and World Wide Web: How to Program</a>, Fourth Edition.  The book may
be purchased at the campus bookstore or through online booksellers.
</p>

<p>
Students are encouraged to use the course mailing list to share
information that would be of general interest or for any other purpose
that seems reasonable.  Mail sent to that address will reach the
instructor and all students.  If you have not received a message from
the mailing list yet, please contact the instructor to make sure that
your correct address is included.
</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>Course grades will be assigned based on homework, a term project, and
an in-class final examination.  With the exception noted below, scores
on each component will be combined to produce a single overall score
for each student as follows:
</p>

<table>

<tr> <th> Component            <th> Portion of Grade


<tr> <td> Homework             <td> 30% (5% each for the best 6 of the 7) 
<tr> <td> Project              <td> 35% 
<tr> <td> Final Exam           <td> 35% 

</table>


<p>
The homework assignments are designed to provide an opportunity for
students to explore specific topics in a structured way.  Students may
work together on the homework assignments, but all of the material
that is turned in for grading must be produced individually.  For
example, students may form study groups and work out homework
solutions together on a chalkboard or by each working separately on
different terminals and then sharing what they have learned, but it
would not be permissible for one student to prepare an answer set and
then for other students to copy those answers and submit it as their
own work.  Turning in copied files is specifically prohibited; each
student must individually type or handwrite any materials that are
submitted for grading, including computer programs.
</p>

<p>Assignments are due before the class indicated on
the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>. A plus/check/minus/zero
system will be used for grading the homework assignments. Check
indicates a satisfactory completion of the assignment. Plus indicates
an impressive mastery of the material. Minus indicates noticeable gaps
in the product. Zero indicates failure to complete the assignment.</p>

 Late policy: for assignments turned in a 24 hours or
less late, I will take your original grade and bump it down a step
(e.g., plus becomes check, check becomes minus, etc.). For assignments
Assignments more than a day late will not be accepted.</p>


<p>
A term project will be completed by each student before the end of the
semester.  Each project will involve implementation of an information
system using technologies covered during the first part of the course.
Students will be assigned to two-person teams; the assignment process
will be based on preferences submitted at the same time as Homework
Assignment 6.  Additional details are provided on the <a
href="hw/P1">project plan Web page</a>.
</p>


<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>The University of Maryland, College Park has a nationally recognized
Code of Academic Integrity, administered by the Student Honor
Council. This Code sets standards for academic integrity at Maryland
for all undergraduate and graduate students. As a student you are
responsible for upholding these standards for this course. It is very
important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the
Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit
<a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu">http://www.shc.umd.edu</a>.</p>


<h2>Class Attendance</h2>

<p>This is a graduate course in which students is responsible for
making their own decisions regarding how best to master the material.
Students will be help accountable for all content covered in class, in
the assigned readings, and in homework and project assignments.
Experience strongly suggests that students should attend class when
they are able to, and that when events preclude class attendance they
should carefully review the posted slides and then discuss what they
missed with one or more classmates before the next class session.
Class attendance for the final project presentations (December 13) is
required.

<h3>Accommodations for Religious Holidays and Other Special
Circumstances</h3>

<p>Students wishing to discuss accommodations for religious holidays
on dates that assignments are due, or other circumstances not
addressed in this course information page, should discuss those
circumstances with me <u>before</u> the third class session in order
to permit adequate time for planning. Only accommodations for
unforeseeable circumstances will be considered after that date.</p>

<h3>Accommodations for Disabilities</h3>

<p>The University is legally obligated to provide appropriate
accommodations for students with documented disabilities.
Accommodations will be made only in accordance with University policy.
Students who are entitled to accommodations due to disabilities must
first set up an appointment with
the <a href="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/DSS/">Disability Support
Services (DSS)</a>. To permit adequate planning, this process must be
completed and I must be notified <b>by DSS</b> at least two weeks
before the session in which the accommodation is required.</p>
