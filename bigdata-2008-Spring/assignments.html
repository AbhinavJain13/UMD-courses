<h3>Weekly Updates</h3>

<p>At each week's project meeting, the project leader and each project
member will agree on a specific deliverable due the following week.
The project meeting will also include a review of the deliverable from
the previous week.  By Monday night (11:59pm) of each week, I expect a
short email from everyone: assessment of last week's deliverables and
next week's plans.  I am requesting emails from everyone so that I
receive multiple viewpoints on what's happening (since they serve as a
basis for evaluation on my part).</p>

<p>Here are some examples of acceptable deliverables:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Project <i>x</i> involves solving sub-problem <i>y</i>:
  sequential algorithm <i>a</i> is the best known method for solving
  <i>y</i>. Deliverable: come up with an algorithm <i>a'</i> that
  takes advantage of MapReduce; report back to the team with a sketch
  of the algorithm, pseudo-code, etc.</li>

  <li>Algorithm <i>a'</i> operates on data structure <i>d</i>.
  Deliverable: implement a Java class that provides the necessary
  abstractions.  The implementation should pass these unit tests.</li>

  <li>Deliverable: implement one aspect of algorithm <i>a'</i>.
  Demonstrate correctness of the algorithm with this data.</li>

  <li>Deliverable: run a set of experiments to evaluate the
  performance algorithm <i>a'</i>.  One metric might be speed, e.g.,
  how much faster is it really?  Or performance can be measured with
  respect to some task, e.g., machine translation performance,
  document retrieval precision, etc.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Blogging</h3>

<p>After each invited speaker for the <a
href="speakers/about.html">cloud computing speaker series</a>, I
expect a blog entry from everyone (due the following day, Thursday, at
11:59pm).  Think of this as a response to the talk: don't just
summarize what happened---instead, try to relate it to your own
project.  What's interesting or not?  As is generally the case, humor
is good.  Of course, don't limit blog entries to just these weekly
responses; if you're in the habit of blogging, write entries as often
as you like.  The point here is to generate some "buzz" about this
cloud computing work.  I will link to everyone's blog from the course
homepage.</p>
