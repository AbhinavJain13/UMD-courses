<h3>Course Schedule and Organization</h3>

<div class="main">

<p>This course will meet MW 11:00am-12:15pm, location <i>TBA</i>.
Please keep in mind that all this information is tentative and subject
to change.  If you have suggestions on how I can improve the course,
please let me know!</p>

<h3>The Overview</h3>

<p>Here an outline of the course schedule:</p>

<p><b>Hadoop "boot camp"</b> (team members): an introduction to the the
 MapReduce programming paradigm.

 <ul>

    <li>Week 1: functional abstraction, implement <a
    href="scheme/MapReduce-in-scheme.html">toy-MapReduce in
    Scheme</a>.</li>

    <li>Week 2: start to work on the cluster---writing and running
    "Hello World" programs.</li>

    <li>Week 3: more substantial programming exercises, graph
    algorithms.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Project management "boot camp"</b> (team leaders): Outside
speakers will be invited to share their experiences in managing
research projects---including such common issues as carving large
problems into smaller pieces for the team members, managing
expectations, etc.</p>

<p><b>Project Work</b> will be divided into two major phases.  Each
team will focus on a specific research problem.</p>

<ul>

  <li>The focus in Phase I is on how existing solutions to the
  research problem can be recast into the MapReduce framework, i.e.,
  how can we hadoopify existing sequential algorithms?</li>

  <li>The focus in Phase II is on interesting extensions, i.e., does
  the MapReduce framework allow us to do something that wasn't
  possible before?</li>

</ul>

<p>Naturally, the exact duration of each phase will differ based on
the individual project and progress; or the phases might be
interwoven.</p>


<h3>Assignments</h3>

<p>Team leaders and team members will have different assignments,
detailed below:</p>

<h3>The Weekly View</h3>

<p>Focusing on a per-week basis, here is the weekly cycle for weeks
4-12:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>
<td width="350"><b>Monday</b></td>
<td width="350"><b>Wednesday</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
<td valign="top">
Project meetings:

<ul>

  <li>Team leaders and members meet to discuss progress, set goals,
  review experiment results, etc.</li>

  <li>Team leaders given the discretion to structure this time as they
  see fit.  Among possible options are: whiteboard sessions,
  discussion of readings, pair programming, demos, etc.</li>

  <li>My role is to serve as facilitator and contribute substantively
  to the extent possible.</li>

</ul>

As necessary, I'll organize informal presentations by the groups to
disseminate information relevant to all projects, e.g., tips and
tricks about the infrastructure.

</td>
<td valign="top">
External speakers will be invited to present their work.  This will
consist of two parts:

<ul>

  <li>Part 1: the speaker will give a research talk (~30
  minutes).</li>

  <li>Part 2: the class will discuss the presented work, focusing in
  particular on how the research problem can be "Hadoopified".</li>

</ul>

The goal of this colloquium series is to expose students to a variety
of different research problems and how MapReduce might be used to
tackle them.  These talks have the secondary goal of building a
broader community around this technology.

<tr>
<td><b>Action Items</b></td>
<td valign="top">
<ul>

  <li>Team leader and each team member agree on a deliverable for the
  coming week.  Example deliverables: writing a piece of code, running
  a set of experiments, deriving a model, etc.</li>

  <li>Team leader and each team member assess the deliverables agreed
  on from the previous week.</li>

</ul>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<ul>

  <li>Each student will write a "response piece" to reflect on the
research presentation and discussion.  This will be posted as a
blog.</li>
