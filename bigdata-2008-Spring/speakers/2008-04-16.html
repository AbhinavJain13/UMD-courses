<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Email management has a fundamental role in work productivity. In
this talk I present evidence that machine learning techniques can be
effectively used to improve email management by modeling different
aspects of user intention. First I propose a taxonomy of Speech Acts
applied to email communication, or "email acts", and show that email
act classification can be largely automated, potentially leading to
better email prioritization and management. Then I describe how
machine learning can be used to reduce the chances of high-cost email
addressing errors. One type of high-cost error is an "email leak",
i.e., mistakenly sending a sensitive email message to the wrong
recipient. Another type of addressing error is forgetting to add an
important collaborator as recipient, a likely source of costly
misunderstandings and communication delays. I'll present different
approaches to these ranking problems, including a new method that
learns fine-tuned feature-based ranking models in two optimization
steps.</p>
