<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>New sequencing technologies have resulted in a dramatic increase in
the amount of data available to biologists.  The large amounts of data
being generated at a rapidly increasing pace, however, are testing the
limits of the current computational infrastructure.  In my talk I will
describe several of the new sequencing technologies and highlight the
computational challenges faced in trying to analyze the data they
generate.</p>

<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Mihai Pop is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer
Science and holds a joint appointment in the Center for Bioinformatics
and Computational Biology at the University of Maryland, College Park.
He received his PhD in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University
in 2000, and prior to his appointment at UMD, he has worked as a
Bioinformatics Engineer at The Institute for Genomics Research, a
leading genomics research institute.  His research is focused on
applications of sequencing technologies: the development of genome
assembly algorithms and the analysis of microbial communities
(metagenomics).</p>
