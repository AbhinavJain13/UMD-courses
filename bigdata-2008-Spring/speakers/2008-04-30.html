<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Delivering on the promise of Cloud Computing requires an
infrastructure able to flexibly handle a large number of requests in
real-time.  As the world's largest system/server company, IBM has
built a virtual IT cloud infrastructure in our Silicon Valley Lab. In
this talk, I will describe IBM's implementation of a cloud computing
infrastructure, with an emphasis on provisioning, cluster management,
and use of open-source solutions.</p>

<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Eugene Hung is a senior software engineer at IBM's Silicon Valley
Laboratory in San Jose, CA. His current work focuses on enabling the
development of Internet-scale applications for cloud computing, a
model for massively parallel systems handling enormous amounts of
data. To support cloud computing, Eugene co-authored an Eclipse
plug-in that interfaces with Hadoop, an open-source implementation of
Google's Map/Reduce framework, to give university students experience
in developing cloud computing applications. He was also lead developer
on Sonoma, a capacity planning tool for IBM machines.  Eugene
completed his PhD on mobile agent templates at the University of
California, San Diego and has been working at IBM since
graduation. Outside of work, he has achieved recognition for winning
two collegiate bridge championships, building the worst fantasy
baseball team in the world, and discovering that IBM is not the right
answer for everything on Jeopardy!</p>
