<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>In these presentations, students in the cloud computing course will
describe what they've accomplished during the semester.</p>

<p><b>Large-Data Statistical Machine Translation</b> (May 7)<br/>
Chris Dyer, Aaron Cordova, Alex Mont</p>

<p>In the last decade, statistical techniques have revolutionized the
field of machine translation.  Using collections of documents that
exist in pairs of languages (so-called bitexts), it is possible to
build models of translation that can be used to translate effectively
between many language pairs with virtually no language-specific
knowledge.  However, the amount of data that is available has grown
more rapidly than the performance of computers, and the research
community now faces a situation where estimating a new model from a
training bitext takes several days with the existing tools.  In this
talk, we show that a large class of models can be naturally expressed
using the MapReduce programming paradigm.  This enables the models to
be parallelized on clusters of commodity hardware and estimated
exactly in a fraction of the time that would be required on a
single-core machine.  We present results showing the scaling
characteristics of estimation code for two word alignment models (IBM
Model 1 and the HMM alignment model) and a phrase-based translation
model.</p>

<p><b>Parallel Automatic Text-Background Separation in Picture Books</b> (May 7)<br/>
Chang Hu and Punit Mehta</p>

<p>We present an image processing system based on the Hadoop MapReduce
framework.  The system leverages existing serial image processing code
and the MapReduce framework to perform text-background separation for
picture books in the International Children's Digital Library.  We
evaluated the performance of the system.  The system also provides an
overall programming paradigm for integrating image processing systems
using the MapReduce framework.</p>

<p><b>Language Modeling with MapReduce</b> (May 14)<br/>
Denis Filimonov and Hua Wei</p>

<p>Parallelization of computationally intensive problems is
challenging but often necessary.  There are different approaches to
parallelization which roughly fall into two categories: single image
systems UMA or NUMA, and clusters of independent nodes communicating
over some protocol, e.g., MPI.  Clusters are typically built of
commodity hardware and thus are much cheaper to scale up, provided the
task in question is suitable for implementation on such cluster.  This
paper describes an implementation of recursive partitioning algorithm
used for LM training in Hadoop, an Open Source implementation of
MapReduce framework.</p>

<p><b>High-throughput Sequence Alignment with Hadoop</b> (May 14)<br/>
Michael Schatz</p>

<p>Next-generation DNA sequencing machines generate sequence data at
an unprecedented rate, but traditional single-processor sequence
alignment algorithms are struggling to keep pace with them.
BlastReduce is a new parallel read mapping algorithm optimized for
aligning sequence data from those machines to reference genomes, for
use in a variety of biological analyses, including SNP discovery,
genotyping, and personal genomics. It is modeled after the widely used
BLAST sequence alignment algorithm, but uses the open-source Hadoop
implementation of MapReduce to parallelize execution to multiple
compute nodes. To evaluate its performance, BlastReduce was used to
map next generation sequence data to a reference bacterial genome in a
variety of configurations. The results show BlastReduce scales
linearly for the number of sequences processed, and with high speedup
as the number of processors increases. In a modest 24 processor
configuration, BlastReduce is up to 250x faster than BLAST executing
on a single processor, and reduced the execution time from several
days to a few minutes at the same level of sensitivity. Furthermore,
BlastReduce is fully compatible with cloud computing, and can be
easily executed on massively parallel remote resources to meet peak
demand. BlastReduce is available open-source at:

<p><b>Joint Resolution of Identity in Email Archives</b><br/>
Tamer Elsayed, Greg Jablonski, and Alan Jackoway</p>

<p>In this project, we explored the design of a MapReduce solution for
jointly resolving all the named-mentions in large email
archives. Since, the resolution of a single mention depends on
resolving other mentions in emails that appear in its context, we
proposed and implemented an iterative solution based on a
graph-structure mapping of the problem. In this talk, we will present
our MapReduce-motivated resolution approach, solutions to challenges
(e.g., pairwise email similarity) that arise due to the large scale of
the problem, and some preliminary results on the Enron collection.</p>

<p><b>Large-Scale Network Analysis to Improve Text Retrieval in the
Biomedical Domain</b><br/>
George Caragea, Christiam Camacho</p>

<p>We introduce PageRankHD, which provides a scalable, easily
extensible implementation of the PageRank algorithm using the Hadoop
framework.  We present results related to the scalability of
PageRankHD as well as the Hadoop framework, and report on
applicability to related document retrieval in the biomedical
domain. We used an implementation of PageRankHD to expand on previous
work by Lin and enhance the retrieval of related articles in the
MEDLINE database at the National Library of Medicine.</p>
