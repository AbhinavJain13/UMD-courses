<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Large datasets are playing an increasingly important role in many
areas of scientific research.  Such datasets can be obtained from
various sources, including sensors on scientific instruments and
simulations of physical phenomena.  The datasets often consist of a
very large number of records, and have an underlying multi-dimensional
attribute space.  Because of such characteristics, traditional
relational database techniques are not adequate to efficiently support
ad hoc queries into the data.  We have therefore developed algorithms
and designed systems to efficiently store and process these datasets
in both tightly coupled parallel computer systems and more loosely
coupled distributed computing environments.</p>

<p>I will mainly discuss the design of two systems, the Active Data
Repository (ADR) and DataCutter, for managing large datasets in
parallel and distributed environments, respectively.  Each of these
systems provides both a programming model and a runtime framework for
implementing high performance data servers. These data servers provide
efficient ad hoc query capabilities into very large multi-dimensional
datasets.  ADR is an object-oriented framework that can be customized
to provide optimized storage and processing of disk-based datasets on
a parallel machine or network of workstations.  DataCutter is a
component-based programming model and runtime system for building data
intensive applications that can execute efficiently in a Grid
distributed computing environment.  I will present optimization
techniques that enable both systems to achieve high performance in a
wide range of application areas. I will also present performance
results on real applications on various computing platforms to support
that claim.</p>


<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Alan Sussman is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science
Department and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies at the
University of Maryland, College Park.  Working with students and other
researchers at Maryland and other institutions he has published over
80 conference and journal papers in various topics related to software
tools for high performance parallel and distributed (Grid) computing,
and has contributed chapters to 6 books.  Software tools he has built
have been widely distributed and used in many computational science
applications, in areas such as earth science, space science, and
medical informatics.  He received his Ph.D. in computer science from
Carnegie Mellon University and his B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science from Princeton University.</p>
