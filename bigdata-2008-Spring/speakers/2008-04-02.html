<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Serial computing has become largely irrelevant for growth in computing
performance at around 2003. All processor vendors have presented
many-core roadmaps expecting exponential increase in the number of cores
over at least a decade. The whole world of computing is now facing the
challenge of coming up with a truly general-purpose parallel computing
platform-the same challenge that eluded high performance computing (HPC)
for so many years--and the clock is ticking. It is becoming common
knowledge that if you want your program to run faster you will have to
program for parallelism, but the vendors who set up the rules have not
yet provided clear and effective means (e.g., programming models and
languages) for doing that.</p>

<p>The PRAM-On-Chip project started at UMD in 1997 foreseeing this
challenge and opportunity. Building on PRAM - a parallel algorithmic
approach that has never been seriously challenged on ease of thinking,
or wealth of its knowledge-base - a comprehensive and coherent platform
for on-chip general-purpose parallel computing has been developed and
prototyped. The approach goes after any type of application parallelism
regardless of its amount, regularity, or grain size. Some prototyping
highlights include: an eXplicit Multi-Threaded (XMT) architecture, a new
64-processor, 75MHz XMT (FPGA-based) computer, 90nm ASIC tapeout of the
key interconnection network component, a basic compiler, class tested
programming methodology where (even high-school) students are taught
only parallel algorithms and pick the rest on their own, and up to 100X
speedups on applications.</p>

<p>The talk will give special attention to how this material was
presented to a dozen high school students (10 from Montgomery Blair, 1
from Walter Johnson and 1 from Thomas Jefferson) in Fall 2007: a full
day tutorial was followed up with only a weekly office-hour by an
undergraduate assistant. Some strong students have been able to complete
5 of 6 assignments given in a graduate course on parallel algorithms.
This informal course was part of a computer club that met after 8 hours
of regular classes (i.e., no academic credit). This suggests that high
school students from  diverse technical backgrounds and abilities,
hopefully everybody who can study standard serial programming, should be
able to study this material if taught in a regular for-credit class by a
professional teacher.</p>

<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Uzi Vishkin got his DSc degree from the Technion, Israel in
1981. He has been a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering
at the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies
(UMIACS) since 1988. His work-depth methodology for presenting
parallel algorithms provided the presentation framework in several
parallel algorithm texts that also include many of his parallel
algorithms. He is the inventor of the PRAM-On-Chip desktop
supercomputer framework under development since 1997 at UMD. He was
elected ACM Fellow in 1996 for, among other things, having "played a
leading role in forming and shaping what thinking in parallel has come
to mean in the fundamental theory of Computer Science", is an
ISI-Thompson Highly Cited Researcher was recently named a Maryland
2007 Innovator of the Year for his PRAM-On-Chip venture.</p>
