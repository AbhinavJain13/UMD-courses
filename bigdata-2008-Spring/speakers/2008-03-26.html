<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The Web provides a unique outlet for individuals to have their
voices heard on a variety of different topics. Often this happens in
the form of subjective opinions, with authors expressing strong
sentiment either in favor or against a product, person, issue,
etc. The number of such opinions on the web is growing at an
impressive rate, by millions per week in the blogosphere alone, to say
nothing of sites that focus on such content like Amazon.com's user
reviews or subjective questions on Yahoo Answers. While sentiment
analysis has recently gained much attention and review mining became
an important topic of research, less emphasis has been put on
efficient text summarization of opinion sentiments.</p>

<p>Rather, opinion mining has been narrowly defined as estimating the
average polarity of sentiments expressed about various facets of the
opinions' target. For products like consumer electronics with a finite
set of features, this model enables relative comparison of targets
within a given category. However, it is not well-suited to targets
with less obvious facets (people, brands, etc.) and does not address
the problem of textually summarizing the sentiments for an individual
target.  For example, reviews of a band's latest album might
overwhelmingly say it is "not as good as their first one", or that it
is "uninspired". These explain the motivation behind the negative
ratings for a particular target where the sentiments don't relate to
obvious facets. I will describe an algorithm for textual summarization
of review sentiments that scales to very large collections and detail
its performance on a dataset comprising several million product
reviews. In doing so, I will characterize the consensus building in
this massive review pool, and discuss the potential for scaling this
algorithm to all of the opinions on the web.</p>

<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Eric Jensen is VP of Development at Summize.com, a sentiment mining
startup based in Northern Virginia. There, he develops novel and
scalable opinion mining and search for blogs, user reviews, and other
user-generated content on the web. He co-founded Summize after
receiving his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Illinois Institute of
Technology Information Retrieval Lab in 2006.  Under a doctoral
fellowship from America Online, his work with the lab focused on
repeatable evaluation of web search effectiveness, query log analysis
and classification, and parallel document clustering algorithms.  He
is the author of over 30 articles in refereed journals, scientific
conferences, workshops, and magazines, and also a U.S. patent
application.</p>
