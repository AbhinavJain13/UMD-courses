<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Distributed Data Mining (DDM) deals with the problem of analyzing
data by paying careful attention to the distributed resources of data,
computing, communication, and human factors in order to use them in a
near optimal fashion. DDM algorithms offer communication efficient,
scalable, and possibly privacy-preserving performance in large
distributed multi-party environments. This talk will start by offering
a perspective of the research in the field of distributed data mining
over the last decade. It will identify some of the important
application areas that have emerged and successfully entered the
commercial domain.  Next it will discuss a few algorithmic
characteristics often needed for scalable performance in the emerging
DDM applications. It will particularly focus on local algorithms for
distributed data analysis.  The talk will consider a few algorithmic
approaches and discuss how scalable local DDM algorithms can be
designed using simple primitives.</p>

<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Hillol Kargupta is an Associate Professor in the Department of
Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland,
Baltimore County. He received the PhD degree in computer science from
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1996. He is also a
co-founder of Agnik LLC, a data analytics company for distributed,
mobile, and embedded environments. His research interests include
mobile and distributed data mining. Dr. Kargupta won a US National
Science Foundation CAREER award in 2001 for his research on ubiquitous
and distributed data mining. He along with his coauthors received the
best paper award at the 2003 IEEE International Conference on Data
Mining for a paper on privacy-preserving data mining. His papers were
also selected for Best of 2008 SIAM Data Mining Conference (SDM'08)
and Most Interesting Paper of WebKDD'06. He won the 2000 TRW
Foundation Award, 1997 Los Alamos Award for Outstanding Technical
Achievement, and 1996 SIAM annual best student paper award. His
research has been funded by the US National Science Foundation, US Air
Force, Department of Homeland Security, NASA, and various other
organizations. He has published more than 80 peer-reviewed articles in
journals, conferences, and books. He has co-edited several books. He
is an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data
Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part
B and Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Journal. He is/was the
General Chair of 2007 NSF Next Generation Data Mining Symposium,
Program Co-Chair of 2005 SIAM Data Mining Conference, Program
vice-chair of 2005 PKDD Conference, Program vice-chair of 2008 &amp; 2005
IEEE International Data Mining Conference, Program Vice Chair for 2008
&amp; 2005 Euro-PAR Conference, Associate General Chair of the 2003 ACM
SIGKDD Conference, and chair of the 2002 NSF Next Generation Data
Mining Workshop among others. He regularly serves in the organizing
and program committee of many data mining conferences.  More
