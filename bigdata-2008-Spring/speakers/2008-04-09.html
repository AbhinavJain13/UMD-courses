<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Cloud computing is a computing platform that resides in large data
centers and is able to dynamically provide servers to address a wide
range of needs, ranging from scientific research to e-commerce. The
provision of computing resources as if it were a utility such as
electricity, while potentially revolutionary as a computing service,
presents many major problems of information policy, including issues
of privacy, security, reliability, access, and regulation. This talk
will explore the nature and potential of cloud computing, the policy
issues raised, and research questions related to cloud computing and
policy. Ultimately, the policy issues raised by cloud computing are
examined as a part of larger issues of public policy attempting to
respond to rapid technological evolution.</p>
