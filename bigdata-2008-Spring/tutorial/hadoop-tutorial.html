<h2>Web-Scale Information Processing Applications: Spring 2008</h2>
<h3>Hadoop Tutorial</h3>
<p>October 19, 2007</p>

<div class="main">

<p>This tutorial will help you get started with Hadoop on the IBM
cluster.  We'll start with installation and end at the word count demo
on a collection consisting of the Bible and Shakespeare's works.  I'm
assuming you have working knowledge of Java and Eclipse.</p>

<h3>Step 0: Relax</h3>

<p>Relax.  Take a deep breath.  Remember that this is bleeding-edge
stuff.  It may not work.  More likely than not, it won't work on the
first try.  You may get frustrated.  (I certainly did the first time I
tried setting everything up.)  Just remember this when you feel like
banging your head against the computer.</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> As of this writing, the latest release of Hadoop is
0.14.2.  If you are using JDK 1.5.x, don't use that release---since it
was compiled with JDK 1.6, you're going to run into many non-obvious
bugs (I learned this the hard way).</p>

<h3>Step 1: Get account on the IBM cluster</h3>

<p>Get your account info from IBM.  Log in via ssh and change your
password.  You'll have to log into the gateway first, and then from
there log into the controller.  Keep note of the IP address of both
the gateway and the controller.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Download Hadoop and Install Plug-in</h3>

<p>Download Hadoop from <a
href="http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/releases.html">http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/releases.html</a>.
Unpack the distribution.  Make sure Eclipse is not running.  The
Hadoop Eclipse plug-in is located <code>contrib/</code> directory,
called <code>hadoop-eclipse-plugin.jar</code>.  Copy that into the
<code>plugins/</code> directory of your Eclipse installation.</p>

<p>Restart Eclipse.  The Eclipse Hadoop plugin should now be
installed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To use the MapReduce perspective go to: Window -> Open
Perspective -> Other... -> Map/Reduce.</li>

  <li>To enable the MapReduce servers window go to: Window -> Show
  View -> Other... -> Map Reduce Tools -> Map Reduce Servers</p>

</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Connect to the IBM Cluster</h3>

<p>Switch to the MapReduce perspective.  At the bottom of your window,
you should have a "MapReduce Servers" tab.  If not, see second bullet
above.  Switch to that tab.</p>

<p>At the top right edge of the tab, you should see two little blue
elephant icons.  The one on the right allows you to add a new
MapReduce server location.  The hostname should be the IP address of
the controller.  You want to enable "Tunnel Connections" and put in
the IP address of the gateway.</p>

<p>At this point, you should now have access to DFS.  It should show
up under a little elephant icon in the Project Explorer (on the left
side of Eclipse).  You can now browse the directory tree.  Find your
home directory: it should be <code>/user/your_username</code>.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Stage the data</h3>

<p>We're next going to stage the data for processing by uploading it
to DFS.  Our <a href="bible+shakes.nopunc">sample collection</a>
consists of the Bible and Shakespeare's works (8,856 KB).  Each line
in this large text file is considered a separate record.  Download
this file and place it in a new folder called
<code>sample-input</code>.  Browse over to your home directory in DFS,
right click on it, and select "Import from local directory".  Upload
the <code>sample-input</code> directory (with the collection in it).
The collection is now staged.</p>

<h3>Step 5: MapReduce away!</h3>

<p>We're almost there... Download <a
href="WordCount.java"><code>WordCount.java</code></a>, the Hadoop
"hello world" program that counts up the occurrences of each word in
the collection.  Create a new Java project in Eclipse and put this
Java program in your project.</p>

<p>You should now be able to run <code>WordCount</code> on the IBM
Hadoop cluster.  Right click on <code>WordCount.java</code> in the
Project Explorer: Run As -> Run on Hadoop.  Select the IBM Hadoop
cluster... and you should be off to the races!  When the job finishes,
verify that you have something like the following:</p>

<pre>
07/10/19 17:32:36 INFO mapred.JobClient:   Map-Reduce Framework
07/10/19 17:32:36 INFO mapred.JobClient:     Map input records=156215
07/10/19 17:32:36 INFO mapred.JobClient:     Map output records=1734298
07/10/19 17:32:36 INFO mapred.JobClient:     Map input bytes=9068074
07/10/19 17:32:36 INFO mapred.JobClient:     Map output bytes=15919397
07/10/19 17:32:36 INFO mapred.JobClient:     Combine input records=1734298
07/10/19 17:32:36 INFO mapred.JobClient:     Combine output records=135372
07/10/19 17:32:36 INFO mapred.JobClient:     Reduce input groups=41788
07/10/19 17:32:36 INFO mapred.JobClient:     Reduce input records=135372
07/10/19 17:32:36 INFO mapred.JobClient:     Reduce output records=41788
</pre>

<p>Go into your DFS home directory, and you should find a new
directory called <code>sample-counts</code>: in it you'll find files
containing counts of each unique word.</p>

<h3>Postscript</h3>

<p>Don't want to depend on the IBM cluster, especially while you are
tinkering around with small programs?  You can run a personal one-node
Hadoop cluster on your local machine: instructions at <a
