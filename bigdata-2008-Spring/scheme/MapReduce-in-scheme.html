<h3>Hadoop "Boot Camp" Assignment #1</h3>

<div class="main">

<p><b>Note:</b> This assignment is still very incomplete... please
stay tuned for more details.</p>

<p>In this assignment, we're going to implement Hadoop in Scheme (no
parallelism, just the functional abstraction!)...  As they say, the
best way to understand something is to build it yourself.  I would
recomend using <a
href="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/">MIT/GNU
Scheme</a>, especially if you are familiar with emacs, since it
provides an emacs-like editing environment.  Otherwise, <a
href="http://jscheme.sourceforge.net/jscheme/main.html">jscheme</a> is
a good Java interpreter for Scheme, written in Java.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we will write a Scheme procedure that looks like the
following:</p>

<pre>
(map-reduce mapper reducer data)
</pre>

<p>The <code>map-reduce</code> procedure takes as input two
other procedures, the mapper and the reducer, and data (key-value
pairs).  Its output is a new set of key-value pairs, as dictated by
the MapReduce programming paradigm.  This may seem daunting, so we'll
get there in smaller steps.</p>

<h3>Sorting</h3>

<p>Let's start with sorting, a staple of computer science.  <a
href="./mergesort.scm">Here</a> you'll find Scheme code that implements
merge sort.  Download it and try it out... you should get something
like this:</p>

<pre>
(mergesort '(1 5 3 7 6 2 8 4))
-> (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
</pre>

<p>So one problem with this merge sort implementation is that the
comparison function is hard coded.  Tweak <code>mergesort</code> so
that it now takes two arguments as input: the first being the list to
sort, and the second being the procedure to use for comparison.  Once
you make the modification, you should be able to do the following:</p>

<pre>
(mergesort '(1 5 3 7 6 2 8 4) <)
-> (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
</pre>

<p>That is, you pass in the <code>&lt;</code> operator as the
comparison method to use in sorting.  Now of course, you can change
the sort order by simply changing the comparator you pass in:</p>

<pre>
(mergesort '(1 5 3 7 6 2 8 4) >)
-> (8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1)
</pre>

<p>Now you can use the primitive predicate <code>string<=?</code> to
sort strings based on their lexicographic order:</p>

<pre>
(mergesort '("f" "a" "c" "h" "e" "d" "b" "g") string<=?)
-> ("a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h")
</pre>

<p>In MapReduce, we're going to have to deal with a lot of key-value
pairs.  Let's represent them in the following manner:</p>

<pre>
(("f" 6) ("a" 1) ("c" 3) ("h" 8) ("e" 5) ("d" 4) ("b" 2) ("g" 7))
</pre>

<p>In other words, as a list of lists.  The first element in each
sublist is a string key.  The second element is the value.  Now write
a comparator that will allow us to sort key-value pairs:</p>

<pre>
(mergesort '(("f" 6) ("a" 1) ("c" 3) ("h" 8) ("e" 5) ("d" 4) ("b" 2) ("g" 7)) proc)
-> (("a" 1) ("b" 2) ("c" 3) ("d" 4) ("e" 5) ("f" 6) ("g" 7) ("h" 8))
</pre>

<p>In other words, write <code>proc</code>.</p>
