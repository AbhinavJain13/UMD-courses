<h2>Web-Scale Information Processing Applications (Spring 2008)</h2>

<h3>Expectations and Grading</h3>

<div class="main">

<p>This is, after all, a course for academic credit, and as such, it
is a requirement that a grade be given by me at the end of the
semester.  Here's how I will be evaluating everyone:</p>

<h3>... for Team Leaders</h3>

<p>Beyond expectations that can be considered "common sense" (showing
up to class, responding to email, etc.), I expect that team leaders
will...</p>

<ul>

  <li>Take their leadership role seriously in guiding the research
  direction of the team, while remaining sensitive to the concerns of
  the team members.</li>

  <li>Take their mentoring role seriously, to ensure that each team
  member receives the best possible experience.</li>

  <li>Arrive at each project meeting organized and well-prepared to
  engage in whatever interactions are necessary.</li>

  <li>Structure weekly-deliverables jointly with and for each team
  member.</li>

  <li>Most of all, have fun!</li>

</ul>

<p>Of course, I will be available as a resource for help.</p>

<p>The components of the final grade are weighted as follows:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">

<tr><td><a href="assignments.html">Detailed research plan</a></td><td>(due 2/12)</td> <td align="right">25%</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="assignments.html">Project update</a></td>        <td>(due 3/31)</td> <td align="right">10%</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="assignments.html">Final project report</a></td>  <td>(due 5/14)</td><td align="right">40%</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Project management</td><td>25%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Team leaders will also be assessed with respect to their ability to
manage their teams, e.g., to structure effective project meetings, to
ensure that team members remain on task, etc. One direct measure of
this is the extent to which team members are satisfactorily completing
deliverables.</p>

<h3>... for Team Members</h3>

<p>Beyond expectations that can be considered "common sense" (showing
up to class, responding to email, etc.), I expect that team members
will...</p>

<ul>

  <li>Arrive at each class with an open mind and a readiness to think
  in different paradigm.</li>

  <li>Engage actively in group and class discussions.</li>

  <li>Make every reasonable attempt to complete weekly
  deliverables.</li>

  <li>Most of all, have fun!</li>

</ul>

<p>You shouldn't take this class if you're not genuinely interested in
MapReduce or not prepared to work hard on challenging open research
problems.</p>

<p>The components of the final grade are weighted as follows:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>Project update</td>                <td>(due 3/31)</td>       <td align="right">10%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final project report</td>          <td>(due 5/14)</td>      <td align="right">30%</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Project work</td>                                  <td align="right">50%</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Class participation</td>                           <td align="right">10%</td></tr>
</table>

<!--p>Since the exact nature of the project work will vary from team to
team, it is difficult to provide specific assignments <i>a priori</i>.
However, I have developed a generic set of guidelines on how project
work will be evaluated.</p-->

<p>The bulk of the grade will come from project work.  After each
week's project meeting, I will assess the deliverables of each team
member according to a three point scale (based on both team leader
input and team member self-assessment):</p>

<table border="1"  cellpadding="4">

<tr><td>check</td> <td>deliverable is adequate</td></tr>

<tr><td>plus</td> <td>deliverable exceeds expectations</td></tr>

<tr><td>minus</td> <td>deliverable is not satisfactory</td></tr>

</table>

<!--p>The project work component of the grade will be an average across
the grade assigned to each deliverable.</p-->
