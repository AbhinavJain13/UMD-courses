<h2>LBSC 888: Doctoral Seminar (Fall 2009): Assignments &amp; Grading</h2>


<h3>Summary</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Class participation: 20%</li>

  <li>Leading a discussion: 20%</li>

  <li>Module creation: 20%</li>

  <li>Final paper and presentation: 40%</li>

</ul>

<p>Also refer to <a href="info.html">my policy on late/incomplete
work</a>.</p>

<h3>Class Participation</h3>

<p>Each class is critical to your learning experience. Your energy in
contributing to class discussions, small-group exercises, and on-going
research will be important.  Therefore, I expect you to attend every
class session, arriving on time.  I expect you to arrive prepared
(e.g., having completed the readings) and eager to engage in
discussions.</p>

<h3>Leading a Discussion</h3>

<p>You will, as part of a small group of two or three students, be
responsible for leading a class discussion lasting approximately an
hour.  We will discuss the details and organization of this activity
in class, but for this activity you will be graded on content,
structure, and participation of others in the course.  I will use the
following <a href="form-discussion-grading.pdf">form</a> for grading.
The entire group will receive a single grade.</p>

<h3>Module Creation</h3>

<p>This is the first step to your creating an integrative paper.  You
will each create a module, patterned after the modules used in the
course, on a topic of your own choosing.  For the module, complete the
following:</p>

<ul>

  <li>select 4-8 papers for people to read for your module</li>
  <li>develop a general description, discussion points, and lens
  descriptions</li>

</ul>

<p>The modules are due on November 18, and for that class session, you
must also prepare a short 10-minute presentation.  You will be graded
on your module's content, structure, and the presentation. I will use
the following <a href="form-module-grading.pdf">form</a> for
grading.</p>

<h3>Final Paper and Presentation</h3>

<p>You will each write an integrative paper based on the module you
have submitted.  This paper should be between 8 and 10 pages,
exclusive of citations.  Details about this final paper will be
discussed in class.  The final paper is due on December 9, and for
that class session, you must also prepare a short 10-minute
presentation.  You will be graded on your paper's content, structure,
and the presentation. I will use the
following <a href="form-final-grading.pdf">form</a> for grading.</p>
