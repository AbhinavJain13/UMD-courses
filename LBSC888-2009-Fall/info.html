<h2>LBSC 888: Doctoral Seminar (Fall 2009): Course Information</h2>

<h3>What's the course about?</h3>

<p>This doctoral seminar provides an introduction to information
studies through four lenses: information, people, environments, and
systems.  The course provides an integrative exploration emphasizing
connections among ideas and research across elements of the field.
The focus of this semester will be to use different lenses to examine
five different modules:</p>

<ul>

<li>Video Games and Learning</li>
<li>Cloud Computing</li>
<li>Values and Ethics</li>
<li>Interactive Search</li>
<li>Lifelong Users</li>

</ul>

<p>The philosophy behind the design of this course is discussed
in:</p>

<blockquote>Allison Druin, Paul T. Jaeger, Kenneth R. Fleischmann,
Jennifer Golbeck, Jimmy Lin, Yan Qu, Ping Wang, and Bo
Xie. <b><a href="readings/Druin_etal_JELIS2009.pdf">The Maryland
Modular Method: An Approach to Doctoral Education in Information
Studies.</a></b>  Journal of Education for Library and Information
Science, 2009, in press.</blockquote>

<p>More explicitly, the goals of this course are as follows:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Gain an understanding of the main areas of the field</li>

  <li>Learn to read and critique research publications</li>

  <li>Learn to synthesize diverse areas of the field for an integrative paper</li>

  <li>Gain experience in presenting research papers</li>

</ul>

<p>See the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> for more details of
what will be covered.  No textbook is required for this course.</p>

<h3>Policy for Attendance and Late/Incomplete Work</h3>

<ul>

  <li><b>Attendance:</b> I expect you to attend every class session,
  arriving on time.  I expect you to arrive prepared (e.g., having
  completed the readings) and eager to engage in discussions.</li>

  <li><b>Assignment deadlines:</b> Assignments are due at the
  beginning of class unless otherwise noted.</li>

  <li><b>Late assignments:</b> If an assignment is late by
  up to 24 hours, the grade will be reduced by 20%.  By 48 hours,
  40%. And so forth.  Exceptions can be discussed in cases of medical
  excuses, family emergencies, etc., but being busy is not a valid
  excuse.  Exceptions will only be considered <i>prior</i> to the
  deadline, and the sooner you talk to me about a problem the more
  likely I will be sympathetic. There are several common problems that
  I am unlikely to consider as valid reasons for failing to get work
  in on time. These include (a) failure to manage your time properly,
  (b) discovering an assignment is harder or takes longer than you
  expected it to be (see item a), and (c) losing documents that should
  have been backed up, unless it's someone else's fault.</li>

  <li><b>'Incomplete' as a grade:</b> I will not issue an
  'incomplete' as a grade except for serious, valid reasons, generally
  in the category of emergencies. See above for some reasons unlikely
  to be considered valid.  If you are having problems of any kind,
  please talk to me as soon as possible. </li>

</ul>

<h3>Academic Integrity </h3>

<p>The University of Maryland, College Park has a nationally
recognized Code of Academic Integrity, administered by the Student
Honor Council.  This Code sets standards for academic integrity at
Maryland for all undergraduate and graduate students. As a student you
are responsible for upholding these standards for this course. It is
very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. Please visit
the <a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu/">Code of Academic Integrity or
the Student Honor Council</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

<p>Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should:
(1) register with and provide documentation to
the <a href="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/DSS/">Disability Support
Services office</a>, and (2) discuss any necessary academic
accommodation with me.  This should be done at the beginning of the
semester, within the first three class sessions.</p>


<h3>Emergency Preparedness</h3>

<p>Information about the status of the campus is available
at <a href="http://www.umd.edu/emergencypreparedness/">the campus
emergency preparedness website</a>.  If the campus is closed, please
make sure to stay safe. Information about possible rescheduling of
course activities will be provided via e-mail once the campus has
