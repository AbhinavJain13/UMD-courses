<h2>CMSC 723: Computational Linguistics I (Fall 2009): Course Information</h2>

<h3>What's the course about?</h3>

<p>This is the first semester in our two-semester graduate sequence in
computational linguistics. In the first semester, we will be discussing
fundamental methods in natural language processing, with a focus on
core representations and algorithms. Topics include: finite-state
methods, context-free and extended context-free models of syntax;
parsing and semantic interpretation; <i>n</i>-gram and Hidden Markov
models, part-of-speech tagging; word sense disambiguation, semantic
distance; and natural language applications. Students completing this
course will have a solid working knowledge of the basics of NLP and
will be well prepared for the second semester course, which covers
natural language processing with a focus on corpus-based statistical
techniques. See the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> for more
details of what will be covered.</p>

<p>The textbook we're using
is <b><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/slp2.html">Speech
and Language Processing</a></b> (2nd edition, 2008), by Jurafsky and
Martin.</p>

<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>

<p>Students taking this course should be competent programmers, since
concepts taught in class will sometimes be reinforced in practice by
hands-on programming assignments.  The course will be taught
in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> with
the <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">Natural Language Toolkit</a>
(NLTK).  We are not assuming a great deal of familiarity with
linguistics; students needing to get up to speed on linguistics
concepts will do fine with Jurafsky and Martin's material on word
classes and context-free grammars for English (Chapters 5 and 12).</p>


<h3>Course Grade</h3>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Exams (50%)</strong>: There will be a midterm exam (25%)
  and a final exam (25%). CS MS comp grade (AI area) will be based
  entirely on the average of the two exams. </li>

  <li><strong>Class assignments (45%):</strong> There will be five
  homework assignments.  Assignment 1 is considered a "warm-up"
  exercise and is worth 5% of your grade.  The rest of the assignments
  are each worth 10% of your grade.</li>

  <li><strong> Class participation (5%):</strong> Showing up for
  class, demonstrating preparedness (i.e., doing the readings), and
  contributing to class discussions. </li>

</ul>

<p>See <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> for assignment due dates
and exams dates.</p>

<h3>Policy for Late and Incomplete Work</h3>

<ul>

  <li><b>Assignment deadlines:</b> Assignments are due at the
  beginning of class unless otherwise noted.</li>

  <li><b>Late assignments:</b> If an assignment is late by up to 24
  hours, the grade will be reduced by 20%.  By 48 hours, 40%. And so
  forth.  Exceptions can be discussed in cases of medical excuses,
  family emergencies, etc., but being busy is not a valid excuse.
  Exceptions will only be considered <i>prior</i> to the deadline, and
  the sooner you talk to me about a problem the more likely I will be
  sympathetic. There are several common problems that I am unlikely to
  consider as valid reasons for failing to get work in on time. These
  include (a) failure to manage your time properly, (b) discovering an
  assignment is harder or takes longer than you expected it to be (see
  item a), and (c) losing code or data that should have been backed
  up, unless it's someone else's fault.</li>

  <li><b>'Incomplete' as a grade:</b> I will not issue an
  'incomplete' as a grade except for serious, valid reasons, generally
  in the category of emergencies. See above for some reasons unlikely
  to be considered valid.  If you are having problems of any kind,
  please talk to me as soon as possible. </li>

</ul>

<h3>Course Software</h3>

<p>You are expected to have a computer for this course, which will be
taught with Python and NLTK.  Information about the software,
including download instructions, is found
on <a href="software.html">this page</a>.</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity </h3>

<p>The University of Maryland, College Park has a nationally recognized
Code of Academic Integrity, administered by the Student Honor Council.
This Code sets standards for academic integrity at Maryland for all
undergraduate and graduate students. As a student you are responsible
for upholding these standards for this course. It is very important
for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication,
facilitation, and plagiarism. Please visit
the <a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu/">Code of Academic Integrity or
the Student Honor Council</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

<p>Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should:
(1) register with and provide documentation to
the <a href="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/DSS/">Disability Support
Services office</a>, and (2) discuss any necessary academic
accommodation with me.  This should be done at the beginning of the
semester, within the first three class sessions.</p>


<h3>Emergency Preparedness</h3>

<p>Information about the status of the campus is available
at <a href="http://www.umd.edu/emergencypreparedness/">the campus
emergency preparedness website</a>.  If the campus is closed, please
make sure to stay safe. Information about possible rescheduling of
course activities will be provided via e-mail once the campus has
reopened.</p>
