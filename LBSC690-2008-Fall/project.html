<h2>LBSC 690: Final Project Information (Fall, 2008)</h2>

<p>The final project is designed to provide you an opportunity to
integrate and extend knowledge acquired throughout the course and to
apply that knowledge to solve a problem of substantial scope.  You are
required to work in groups of three, and should plan to devote time
approximately equal to two homework assignments (multiplied by three
people).  Experience suggests that successful teams require expertise
in design, implementation, and project management.</p>

<p>Accompanying each project will be a presentation Wednesday, 12/10.
Each group will get ten minutes to present their work, followed by
five minutes for questions.</p>

<p>Projects are required to make substantial use of at least two of
the following technologies introduced in the course, integrated in a
manner that is appropriate for the intended application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web-based content delivery (HTML with CSS)</li>
  <li>XML</li>
  <li>Relational databases</li>
  <li>Multimedia content</li>
  <li>Programming (e.g., JavaScript)</li>
</ul>

<p>Projects must be designed to address an information-related problem
and are required to have substantial content. If you have questions
regarding scope, please ask me.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you structure your ten-minute presentation
into two separate parts, a PowerPoint presentation and a demo of your
project (although how long you devote to each would depend on the
project).  Your presentation should address the following
questions:</p>

<ul>

<li>What problem did you solve?</li>

<li>How did you figure out what exactly was needed?</li>

<li>How did you organize your group?  Who did what?</li>

<li>How well does the project deliver on what it was designed to
   accomplish?</li>

<li>What did you learn about the nature of your problem?</li>

<li>What did you learn about the capabilities and limitations of the
   technologies that you chose to work with?</li>

</ul>

<p>Of course, different groups will devote more or less time to each
of these, and some groups will add other things.  There is no cookbook
recipe for a good project.  The key is to learn a lot, and to describe
what you have learned!</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>The final project will be worth 35% of your total grade.  The
breakdown of the grade will be as follows:</p>
