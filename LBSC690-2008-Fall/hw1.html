<h2>LBSC 690: Assignment #1 (Fall 2008)</h2>

<p>This assignment is due before class on 9/17.  To turn in your
assignment, send me an email with the subject "LBSC 690 assignment
#1".  In the message body, either type your answers to attach a
document that contains the answer.  Show your work, as it will provide
an opportunity to receive partial credit.</p>

<p>Consider the specifications of a computer system that you might
consider buying:</p>

<blockquote>
Processor type: Intel Core 2 Duo<br/>
Processor speed: 2.5 GHz<br/>
Hard drive: 200 GB, 10 ms access time<br/>
RAM: 2 GB, 50 ns access time<br/>
Peripherals: DVD-RW<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>Although we talked about modern processors having multiple "cores",
for this assignment assume that all operations are performed by a
single core.  To simplify calculations, you can assume that 1 megabyte
is 1,000,000 (one million) bytes, 1 gigabyte is 1,000,000,000 (one
billion) bytes, etc.</p>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>If you buy some 4.7 GB DVDs, how many would you need to back up
a full hard drive to DVDs (assuming no compression)?  At 30 cents per
DVD, how much would a full backup cost?  At 10 minutes per DVD, how
long would a full backup take?</p></li>

<li><p>Now let's see how much stuff that hard drive can hold.  Assume
you have access to the following information for all 300 million
people in the United States:</p>

<blockquote>
Name: 40 characters<br/>
Phone Number: 10 characters<br/>
SSN: 9 characters<br/>
taxes owed: one four-byte number<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>Assume that each character is stored in one byte.</p>

<p>Would all of these data fit on the hard drive of the computer
described above?  If not, how big a hard drive would you need?  If so,
what fraction of the disk would this fill?</p>

</li>

<li><p>Now let's see how long it would take to read that much data off the
disk.  Assume you have a hard drive large enough to store all the
data.</p>

<p>Suppose you wanted to add up the taxes owed by all 300 million
people.  Assume that you access the data in a random order, and that
you start a new disk access for each person (in the specifications
above I have provided the latency of disk access).  How long would it
take to access all the data?  Could this be done in a second?  In a
minute?  In an hour?  In a day?  In a month?  In a year?</p>

</li>

<li><p>Assume for the sake of comparison that all of this data could fit
in RAM.</p>

<p>How long would it take to access all the data from RAM?  In the
specifications above I have provided the latency of RAM access. Could
this be done in a second?  In a minute?  In an hour?  In a day?  In a
month?  In a year?</p>

</li>

<li><p>Which is faster, RAM or the hard disk?</p></li>

<li><p>Now let's see how long it would take to move the bits around.</p>

<p>How long would it take to move the contents of your entire hard
drive to your friend's computer in California over a modem?  Over DSL?
Over a dedicated T1 line?  Overnight mail?</p>

</li>

</ol>
