<h2>LBSC 690: Course Information (Fall 2008)</h2>

<h3>1. Description and Goals</h3>

<p>This is a core course in the Master of Library Science (MLS)
program.  It provides an introduction to information technologies as
it pertains to libraries, archives, schools, and other
information-centric organizations.  Emphasis is placed on the design
of systems for connecting users with information.  The goals of the
course are:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Understand basic principles behind the operation of computers
  and networks.</li>

  <li>Understand technologies for the organization, management, and
  delivery of structured and unstructured information.</li>

  <li>Understand user-centered design principles for information
  systems.</li>

  <li>Develop competence in basic Web design.</li>

</ul>

<p>The textbook for the course is
"<a href="http://www.course.com/catalog/product.cfm?isbn=978-1-4239-1198-2">Discovering
Computers 2009: Complete</a>" by Gary B. Shelly, Thomas J. Cashman,
Misty E. Vermaat.  An earlier (reasonably recent) edition of the
textbook is acceptable, but if you use an earlier edition, check to
make sure the chapter numbers are the same!  All additional course
material will be available on the course homepage.</p>

<p>This course assumes that you already have the following skills:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Create a document using a word processing program such as
  Microsoft Word.</li>

  <li>Send and receive email, including attachments.</li>

  <li>Find Web pages using a search engine; navigate Web sites.</li>

  <li>Print documents, Web pages, and other documents.</li>

</ul>

<p>These skills are not taught as a part of this course.  If you have
concerns about mastery of these skills, please contact me before the
second class session.</p>

<p>Finally, it is required that you have regular access to a computer
and an Internet connection throughout this course.  A laptop is
preferable.  If you have a laptop, it would be useful to bring the
laptop to class, especially for the lab sessions (see below).</p>

<h3>2. Approach</h3>

<p>This course is organized into two-week blocks, each focusing on a
particular topic (see <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> for more
details).  The first session of each block will be primarily devoted
to building fundamental concepts, where emphasis is placed
on <i>ideas</i>.  These sessions will be conducted along a more
traditional lecture format with discussions at appropriate junctures.
The second session of each block will be devoted to technology
presentations, i.e., "labs".  The purpose of each lab is to help you
acquire the necessary skills in applying information technology to
solve real world problems.  Each lab will consist of demos and
hands-on exercises that complement the concepts introduced in the
previous session.  If you have a laptop, make sure to bring it to the
lab sessions.</p>

<h3>3. Grading</h3>

<p>Components of the final grade are as follows:</p>

<table cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><td>Assignments (5 total)</td><td>20%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final exam</td><td>35%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final project</td><td>35%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Class participation</td><td>10%</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td>100%</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>3.1 Assignments</h4>

<p>There will be a total of five homework assignments due throughout
the semester.  Together, they are worth 20% of your final grade.
Assignments are designed to help you learn the material, so please use
them for that!  You are allowed to collaborate with others (as many
people as you'd like), but you must turn in your own assignment.  For
example, you could work together in a group, but each person must
write up their solutions individually.</p>

<p>All completed assignments will be posted on the Web, on your
homepage.  At the end of the semester, you'll have a complete record
of your accomplishments (i.e., a Web portfolio).  For the first
assignment, please email me the URL of your homepage.  For
convenience, you are encouraged to use your WAM account to host your
files.  Note that you can choose to make your homepage public or
private&mdash;this will be discussed in class.</p>

<p>Assignments are due before the class indicated on the
<a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  A plus/check/minus system will
be used for grading the homework assignments.  Check indicates a
satisfactory completion of the assignment.  Plus indicates an
impressive mastery of the material.  Minus indicates noticeable gaps
in the product.  Late policy: for assignments turned in a day or less
late, I will take your original grade and bump it down a step (e.g.,
plus becomes check, check becomes minus, etc.).  Assignments more than
a day late will not be accepted.</p>

<h4>3.2 Final Exam</h4>

<p>There will be an in-class final exam on 12/3 during normal class
time.  This final is cumulative, but will be open book, so
memorization is not required.  However, it is wise that you gain
mastery of all concepts, and only use course materials to look up
specific information.  The final exam will be worth 35% of your
grade.</p>

<h4>3.3 Final Project</h4>

<p>More information will be posted on a separate page for the final
project.</p>

<h4>3.4 Class Participation</h4>

<p>Each class is critical to your learning experience, and I expect
you to come to class prepared (having read all assigned readings,
ready to engage).  I also expect active participation, not passive
reception of the material.  Your energy in contributing to class
discussions and hands-on exercises will make this class an enjoyable
experience for all of us.  Class participation is worth 10% of your
total grade.</p>

<p>I have a simple way for assessing class participation.  In the
beginning, everyone starts out with five points (out of a total of
ten).  Depending on the factors discussed above, this score will be
increased or decreased as appropriate.</p>

<h3>4. Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>The University of Maryland, College Park has a nationally
recognized Code of Academic Integrity, administered by the Student
Honor Council.  This Code sets standards for academic integrity at
Maryland for all undergraduate and graduate students.  As a student
you are responsible for upholding these standards for this course.  It
is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the
Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit
