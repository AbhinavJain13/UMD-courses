<p class="style1">I've been an assistant professor in the College of
Information Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park since
September, 2004. I'm a member of the Computational Linguistics and
Information Processing (CLIP) Lab at the Institute for Advanced
Computer Studies (UMIACS).
</p>

<p class="style2">In August 2004, I completed my Ph.D. in the
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department (EECS) from
MIT, where I was working in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). My Ph.D. thesis was titled Event
Structure and the Encoding of Arguments: The Syntax of the Mandarin
and English Verb Phrase.
</p>

<p>My current research lies at the intersection of information
retrieval, information science, and computational linguistics, in an
area called question answering (QA). The goal is to develop
information access systems that return "answers", not merely
"hits".</p>
