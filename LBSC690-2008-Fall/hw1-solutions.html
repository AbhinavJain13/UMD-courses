<h2>LBSC 690: Assignment #1 Solutions (Fall 2008)</h2>

<p>For this assignment, consider the specifications of a computer
system that you might consider buying:</p>

<blockquote>
Processor type: Intel Core 2 Duo<br/>
Processor speed: 2.5 GHz<br/>
Hard drive: 200 GB, 10 ms access time<br/>
RAM: 2 GB, 50 ns access time<br/>
Peripherals: DVD-RW<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>Although we talked about modern processors having multiple "cores",
for this assignment assume that all operations are performed by a
single core.  To simplify calculations, you can assume that 1 megabyte
is 1,000,000 (one million) bytes, 1 gigabyte is 1,000,000,000 (one
billion) bytes, etc.</p>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>

<li>If you buy some 4.7 GB DVDs, how many would you need to back up a
full hard drive to DVDs (assuming no compression)?  At 30 cents per
DVD, how much would a full backup cost?  At 10 minutes per DVD, how
long would a full backup take?

<blockquote>
<b>Answer:</b><br/>
200 GB / 4.7 GB per DVD = 42.55 or 43 DVDs<br/>
43 DVDs at $0.30 per DVD = $12.90<br/>
43 DVDs at 10 minutes = 430 minutes = 7 hours, 10 minutes
</blockquote>

<p>Now let's see how much stuff that hard drive can hold.  Assume you
have access to the following information for all 300 million people in
the United States:</p>

<blockquote>
Name: 40 characters<br/>
Phone Number: 10 characters<br/>
SSN: 9 characters<br/>
taxes owed: one four-byte number<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>Assume that each character is stored in one byte.</p>

</li>

<li>Would all of these data fit on the hard drive of the computer
described above?  If not, how big a hard drive would you need?  If so,
what fraction of the disk would this fill?

<blockquote>
<b>Answer:</b><br/>
Record for each person would take up (40 + 10 + 9 + 4) = 63 bytes<br/>
63 bytes per record * 300,000,000 records = 18,900,000,000 bytes = 18.9 GB<br/>
18.9 GB / 200 GB = 0.0945, or all the data would only take up 9.45% of the entire hard drive
</blockquote>

<p>Now let's see how long it would take to read that much data off the
disk.  Assume you have a hard drive large enough to store all the
data.</p>

</li>

<li>Suppose you wanted to add up the taxes owed by all 300 million
people.  Assume that you access the data in a random order, and that
you start a new disk access for each person (in the specifications
above I have provided the latency of disk access).  How long would it
take to access all the data?  Could this be done in a second?  In a
minute?  In an hour?  In a day?  In a month?  In a year?

<blockquote>
<b>Answer:</b><br/>
300 million people means 300,000,000 disk accesses.<br/>
Each access takes 10ms (which is 0.01s), so 300,000,000 disk accesses would take 3,000,000 seconds<br/>
3,000,000 seconds / 86,400 seconds per day = 34.72 days, or a bit more than one month
</blockquote>

<p>Assume for the sake of comparison that all of this data could fit
in RAM.</p>

</li>

<li>How long would it take to access all the data from RAM?  In the
specifications above I have provided the latency of RAM access. Could
this be done in a second?  In a minute?  In an hour?  In a day?  In a
month?  In a year?

<blockquote>
<b>Answer:</b><br/>
300 million people means 300,000,000 RAM accesses.<br/>
Each access takes 50ns (which is 50 billionths of a second), so 300,000,000 RAM access would take 15 seconds.
</blockquote>

</li>

<li>Which is faster, RAM or the hard disk?

<blockquote>
<b>Answer:</b><br/>
RAM is much faster than the hard drive.
</blockquote>

<p>Now let's see how long it would take to move the bits around.</p>

</li>

<li>How long would it take to move the contents of your entire hard
drive to your friend's computer in California over a modem?  Over DSL?
Over a dedicated T1 line?  Overnight mail?

<blockquote>
<b>Answer:</b><br/>
Note that transfer speeds are often measured in bits, not bytes.<br/>
200 GB = 200,000,000,000 bytes = 1,600,000,000,000 bits 

<p>Modem: 56 Kbps<br/>
1,600,000,000,000 bits / 56,000 bits per second = 28,571,429 seconds = 330.7 days</p>

<p>DSL: 256 Kbps<br/>
1,600,000,000,000 bits / 256,000 bits per second = 6,250,000 seconds = 72.3 days</p>

<p>T1: 1.544 Mbps = 1,544 Kbps<br/>
1,600,000,000,000 bits / 1,544,000 bits per second = 1,036,269 seconds = 12 days</p>

<p>Overnight mail: takes overnight!</p>
</blockquote>
