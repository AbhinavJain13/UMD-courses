This Course Catalog for Spring 2006 CLIS courses was created by Meghan Spence, Elizabeth Hodges, and Deana Kussman for Jimmy Lin's LBSC 690 (Fall 2005). The database is created using Microsoft Access. SQL and php are used for the programming and database queries. A local server was set up on a laptop (WAM accounts and other web accounts accessible by CLIS students are not php-enabled) using Apache.

Here are the steps to set up the website:

1. Set up the Apache server with php enabled. We used a free download from XAMPP:
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html 
The choices you make for downloading will differ if you have a different system than we did or if the downloads have been updated, but at the time we created the website, we downloaded "XAMPP Windows 1.5.1" then followed the instructions for installation with installer. Out of all the installations and downloads we tried, this one was the only one that worked. Just follow the instructions and it'll work.

This will set up a folder:
C:\Program Files\xampp

__________
2. Look for a subfolder called "htdocs". This is where you will save your access database, your html files, your php files and your css file. For now you will need to save your access database there.

____________
3. Set up the ODBC connection. Instructions are available at: http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_db_odbc.asp

___________
4. Open a browser window and check that this URL works:
http://localhost/

_________
5. At this point you need to set up your php files. Take a look at the php files in this zip file. The index.html file is your homepage, and the php files are linked to from that file.
