Back in 1942, the United States was at war with Japan.  Afraid of having spies living in our country, the government made a bold decision.  All Japanese Americans were moved from the west coast and relocated to internment camps.  The camps were not a great place to live.  The camps were crowded and the people had very little to do.  The children started disrespecting their elders and everyone was on edge.  
What they needed was someway to keep busy and have some fun.  Maybe baseball would be the answer.

Well Miss Smith has a very special storybook she reads to her class.  When she reads the stories, the characters pop out of the book right into the classroom!  Can you imagine?  The only way to get the characters back into the book is by finishing the story.

But, did you know that before she was the tooth fairy, Mabel -- that's her real name -- refused to brush her teeth or floss or go to the dentist.  As you can imagine, her teeth got rotten and started to fall out.  
How did she go from someone who didn't take care of her own teeth to the Tooth Fairy?  I'll leave that to you to find out!

Molly Moon has a miserable existence.  She was left on the doorstep of the orphanage as a infant.  There is no information about who she is or who her parents are.

Life just can't get any worse.  But then she finds THE BOOK.  It's quite by accident, of course.  She's feeling very low and hides out in the library.  When she overhears a conversation that mentions a very important book, she can't believe her eyes when she actually finds it.  Hypnotism : an Ancient Art Explained by Doctor H. Logan. Hypnotism.  Could that stuff really exist? 
 When Molly "borrows" the book, she finds that she indeed has the gift!

It's the first day of school and Judy Moody is in a mood.  And it's NOT a good mood! 
 She is certain that third grade won't be as much fun as second.  But Judy is wrong.  
Lots of funny and silly things happen as Judy works on her first homework assignment, a ME collage, with her little brother, Stink, and best friend, Rocky.  
You'll laugh out loud when Judy gets a new pet, a fly-eating plant, and makes up the T.P. club.  
(See if you can guess what T.P. stands for while you read this hilarious book.)  (Jean Bellavance bellavance@erols.com for Pennsylvania Young Reader's Choice Awards, 2003)

"The very last words young Fergal McNally heard in his life were: 'Don't lean out of the window!'  
The very last sounds were probably the air whistling past his sticky-out ears as he fell the fourteen stories, the honk of traffic horns below (getting nearer and nearer, of course), and -- possibly -- the SP of the SPLAT! he himself made as he hit the pavement."  So begins the tale of Fergal McNally.  What had brought Fergal to that window involves his sisters, his one legged father, and, of course, the Tap 'n Type contest.  
Don't worry too much about Fergal.  Things are not always as they seem.

Despereaux is an unlikely hero.   Very small, with huge ears, with no proper mouse instincts: he is not long for this world.  Enter the Princess Pea, the lovely child princess who dwells in the very same castle as our small hero, Despereaux.  
He falls, like his name, desperately in love with her and  pledges his life to her service.  
But how, reader, how can a mouse, especially one like ours, hope to serve the Princess Pea?  
Especially when in the next breath after meeting her, he is sentenced by his own kind to die in the dungeon, to be tortured and eaten by rats? 
 Our hero is small, but his fate is huge.  This, reader, is the tale.  The Tale of Despereaux. (Jocelyn Deal, dealj@clarke.k12.ga.us, Winterville Elementary School, Winterville, GA)

 So often she has complained about how boring her town is.  But now all that is about to change. 
 The trial of the man accused of kidnapping and murdering the son of Charles Lindbergh will be taking place in Katie Leigh's small town. 
 And Katie Leigh will be in the court room watching.  Others may be caught up in the rise of Adolph Hitler in Germany or the homelessness caused by the depression in America, but for the residents of Flemington, New Jersey, their trial is all that's important.

Dad's in jail -- again.  Now don't get him wrong.  He's not a bad person.  He just acts impulsively sometimes.  He doesn't stop to think about the consequences when he sees something  wrong.  Like the time he saw the tourists beating their dogs.  But now he's really in trouble.  
Now he has sunk the casino boat!  Dad is furious that the owner is emptying the bilge tanks directly into the water instead of paying to have it hauled away.  
He can't prove it so he does the only thing he can think of -- swamps the boat.  So, now he's in jail and no one believes him.  Can his son find a way to prove that the beach is being polluted because of the casino boat?
