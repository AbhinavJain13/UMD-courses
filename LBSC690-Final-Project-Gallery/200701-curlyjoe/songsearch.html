Searching hints and tips:<br>
-If the song was originally released as a single, the "album name" field is left blank.<br> 
-If there are multiple known versions of a song, the earliest known listing will prevail unless one version of a song is dramatically better known!<br>
-Songs that are close to being 'between decades' will appear in both listings; for example, a single or album released in late 1969/early 1970, etc. will be listed as both a 1960s and 1970s song. <br>
