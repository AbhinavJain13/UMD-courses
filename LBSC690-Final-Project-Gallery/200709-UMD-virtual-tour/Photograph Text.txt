McKeldin Library

The $2.5 million McKeldin Library was completed in December of 1957 and opened to students on January 6, 1958. The library was named for then Governor Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin who helped secure funding for the library from the Maryland Legislature in 1955. The new library was designed to hold about 1 million books and smoking was allowed in most parts of the library. A $30 million addition to the library was incorporated in 1990.


Rossborough Inn

Built in 1798, the Rossborough Inn is today the oldest building on the campus of the University of Maryland College Park, but did not actually become part of the campus until some years later. Over the years it has variously served as a hostel for travelers, a social center for the Washington and southern Maryland elite, an agricultural experiment station, and a faculty and alumni club.


Byrd Stadium

Named for University of Maryland student, coach, and University President, Harry Clifton “Curley” Byrd, the original Byrd Stadium, fondly called “The Byrd Cage”, was located on what is now Fraternity Row. It was first called the University of Maryland Athletic Field but was later renamed at the insistence of students. The current Byrd Stadium has undergone various renovations and expansions, the most recent of which was the addition of a $10.9 million upper deck in 1995.
