<p class="style1">I'm an associate professor in the iSchool at the University of Maryland. I joined the faculty in August 2004, shortly after completing my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, and was promoted to associate professor in March 2009. I also have appointments in the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) and the Department of Computer Science at Maryland.</p>

<p class="style2">I work at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), with a recent emphasis on scalable algorithm design and large-data issues. I'm a member of both the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing Lab (CLIP) and the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL).</p>

<p>For fun, I like to... wait, I don't have time for fun.</p>
