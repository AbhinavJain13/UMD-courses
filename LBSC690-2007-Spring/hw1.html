<h2>LBSC 690: Homework #1</h2>

<p><a href="index.html">Back to main page</a></p>

<p><b>Perform Some Calculations</b></p>

<p>First, let's look at the specification for a computer system that
you might consider buying:</p>

<blockquote>
Processor type:         Intel Core<br/>
Processor speed:        3 GHz<br/>
Hard drive:             80 GB, 10 ms access time<br/>
RAM:                    512 MB<br/>
Additional peripherals: CD-RW<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>1.</b> If you buy some 640 MB CD-R disks, how many would you need
to back up a full hard drive once (assume no compression)?  At 7 cents
per disk, how much would a full backup cost?  At 10 minutes per disk,
how long would a full backup take?</p>

<p>Now let's see how much stuff that hard drive can hold.  Assume you
have access to the following information stored for all 295 million
people in the United States</p>

<blockquote>
Name:                40 characters<br/>
Phone Number:        10 characters<br/>
Library Card Number: 9 characters<br/>
Unpaid Fines:        one 4-byte number<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>Assume that each character is stored in one byte.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Would all of this data fit on the hard drive of the
computer described above?  If not, how big a hard drive would you
need?  If so, what fraction of the disk would this fill?</p>

<p>Now let's see how long it would take to read that much data off the
disk.  Assume you have a hard drive large enough to store all the
data.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Assume that you access the data in a random order, and
that you start a new disk access for each person.  How long would it
take to add up the library fines for all 295 million people?  Could
this be done in a second?  In a minute?  In an hour?  In a day?  In a
month?  In a year?</p>

<p>Assume for the sake of comparison that all of this data could fit in
RAM (it won't; you should convince yourself of that).</p>

<p><b>4.</b> How long would it take the processor to perform 295
million additions if it can perform one addition instruction for every
two clock cycles?  Could this be done in a second?  In a minute?  In
an hour?  In a day?  In a month?  In a year?</p>

<p>From these answers, you should be able to conclude that the
processor is <i>much</i> faster than the hard drive.  Review your
notes and read the section in the book about "virtual memory".  Think
about how virtual memory helps to accommodate this mismatch.</p>

<p>Now let's see how long it would take to move the bits around.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> How long would it take to move the contents of your
entire hard drive to your friend's computer in California over a
modem?  Over DSL?  Over a dedicated T1 line?  Overnight mail?</p>
