<h2>LBSC 690 (Spring, 2007): Final Project Information</h2>

<p><a href="index.html">Back to main page</a></p>

<p>The final project is designed to provide you an opportunity to
integrate and extend knowledge acquired throughout the course and to
apply that knowledge to solve a problem of substantial scope.  You are
required to work in groups of three, and teams should plan to devote
time approximately equal to two homework assignments (multiplied by
three people).  Experience suggests that successful teams require
expertise in design, implementation, and project management.</p>

<p>Accompanying each project will be a presentation during Monday,
5/7.  Each group will get ten minutes to present their work, followed
by five minutes for questions and hands-on exploration by the
instructor and GA.  A sign-up sheet for time slots will be posted
later in the semester.</p>

<p>Projects are required to make substantial use of at least two of
the following technologies introduced in the course, integrated in a
manner that is appropriate for the intended application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web-based content delivery (HTML with CSS)</li>
  <li>XML</li>
  <li>Relational databases</li>
  <li>Synchronized multimedia content</li>
  <li>Programming (e.g., JavaScript)</li>
</ul>

<p>Projects are also required to include significant real content;
mock-ups that contain only a limited quantity of content for
demonstration purposes would not be acceptable.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you structure your ten-minute presentation
into two separate parts, a PowerPoint presentation and a demo of your
project (although how long you devote to each would depend on the
actual project).  Your presentation should answer at least the
following questions:</p>

<ul>

<li>What did you do?</li>

<li>How did you do it? This has two aspects: (1) how did you learn
   what was really needed (did you just make it up, or do you have a
   real customer?), and (2) how did you organize your efforts (i.e.,
   who did what?)</li>

<li>What did you learn about the nature of your problem?</li>

<li>What did you learn about the capabilities and limitations of the
   technologies that you chose to work with?</li>

<li>How well does the project deliver on what it was designed to
   accomplish?</li>

</ul>

<p>Of course, different groups will devote more or less time to each
of these, and some groups will add other things.  There is no cookbook
recipe for a good project.  The key is to learn a lot, and to describe
what you have learned.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>The final project will be worth 35% of your total grade.  The
breakdown of the grade will be as follows:</p>

<table>
<tr><td width="150"><b>Criteria</b></td><td><b>Points</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Content</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Technology</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Interface</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oral Presentation</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td>15</td></tr>
</table>
