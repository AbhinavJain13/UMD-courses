<h2>LBSC 690: Homework #3</h2>

<p><b>Jump the XML bandwagon</b></p>

<p>You are the head technology honcho for an organization.  Recently,
your boss has caught the XML bug and can't stop talking about it.  She
has charged you with XML-ifying your entire organizational process and
data store, whatever that means...  Unfortunately, you don't think she
really understands what XML is/does.</p>

<p>Your job is to critically evaluate XML technologies with respect to
the needs of your organization, and to see if they "fit".  Choose one
of the following as your organization:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Sacred Heart Hospital.</b> You're in charge of patient
  records and your job is to make sure doctors, insurance companies,
  and other hospitals get the information they need in a timely and
  efficient manner.  Keep in mind that the information you're storing
  not only includes a patient's medical history, but also things like
  x-ray film, EKG results, etc.  With the recent emergence of wireless
  technologies, doctors would like to access patient records from
  different places: the desktop in their office, a hand-held or PDA at
  the point of service (i.e., by the patient).  Insurance companies
  and other hospitals, however, have different needs.  For one, they
  should only have access to the information they're supposed to have;
  e.g., if we're referring a patient to another hospital for back
  problems, the OBGYN records probably shouldn't be sent along.</li>

  <li><b>Widgets International.</b> Widgets International is the
  world's biggest producer of widgets, a complex device comprised of
  hundreds of parts that must be put together in an intricate assembly
  line.  You have huge warehouses of raw materials and dozens of
  suppliers that regularly compete for your large contracts.
  Maintaining your supply chain and coordinating the intricate dance
  of making widgets is no easy task, but you are always looking for
  ways to improve the efficiency.</li>

</ul>

<p>Your task is to create a website that contains the following three
components (not necessary one page each):</p>

<ul>
  <li>A brief introduction to your technologically-clueless
  pointy-haired boss about what this XML thing is.</li>

  <li>An overview of how things are currently being done at your
  organization.</li>

  <li>An overview of how things could be done with XML, along with a
  recommendation of whether or not it's a good idea (taking into
  considerations costs, disruption, migration of technology,
  etc.).</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition to substantial content, you will be expected to produce
a well-designed, visually-appealing website.  Use of CSS is expected,
as well as other HTML elements (tables, lists, etc.), as
appropriate.</p>
