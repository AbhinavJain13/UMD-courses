<h2>LBSC 690 (Spring, 2007): Class Organization and Grading</h2>

<p><a href="index.html">Back to main page</a></p>

<h3>Class Organization</h3>

<p>Much of this course is organized into two-week blocks, each
focusing on a particular topic (see <a href="schedule.html">class
schedule</a> for more details).  The first session of each block will
be primarily devoted to building fundamental concepts, where emphasis
is placed on
<i>ideas</i>.  These sessions will be conducted along a more
traditional lecture format, although structured discussions will be
integrated at appropriate junctures.  The second session of each block
will be devoted to technology presentations.  The purpose of each
technology presentation is to help you acquire the necessary skills in
applying information technology to solve real world problems.  Each
technology presentation will consists of demos and hands-on lab
exercises that complement the concepts introduced in the previous
session.</p>

<h3>Homeworks</h3>

<p>There will be a total of five homework assignments due throughout
the semester.  Together, they are worth 20% of your final grade.
Homeworks are designed to help you learn the material, so please use
them for that!  You are allowed to collaborate with others (as many
people as you'd like), but you must turn in your own assignment.  For
example, you could work together in a group, but each person must
write up their solutions individually.</p>

<p>All completed assignments will be posted on the Web, on your
homepage.  At the end of the semester, you'll have a complete record
of your accomplishments (a Web portfolio).  For the first assignment,
please email me the URL of your homepage.  For convenience, you are
encouraged to use your WAM account to host your files.</p>

<p><b>Grading:</b> A plus/check/minus system will be used for grading
the homework assignments.  Check indicates a satisfactory completion
of the assignment.  Plus indicates an impressive mastery of the
material.  Minus indicates noticeable gaps in the product.  Late
policy: for assignments turned in a day or less late, I will take your
original grade and bump it down a step (e.g., plus becomes check,
check becomes minus, etc.).  Assignments more than a day late will not
be accepted.</p>

<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>There will be two exams, a midterm and a final.</p>

<ul>

  <li>The midterm will be a take-home exam, conducted seomtime around
  spring break.  At a set time, I will post the exam online.  You may
  download the questions and take the exam any time during the
  weekend.  There will be a time limit on the exam; answers will be
  submitted via email.  I expected everyone to abide by an honor code.
  More details will be posted as the exam date nears.  However, please
  plan accordingly for that weekend.  Let me know ASAP if there are
  genuine reasons why this is impossible for you.</li>

  <li>The final exam will be similar in setup to the midterm, and
  the exam will be cumulative.</li>

</ul>

<p>Both exams together will be worth 35% of your final grade.  The
higher of the two will be weighted more heavily (25%); the other will
be weigthed less (10%).</p>

<h3>Final Project</h3>

<p>See <a href="project.html">separate page for the final project</a>.</p>

<h3>Class Participation</h3>

<p>Each class is critical to your learning experience, and I expect
you to come to class prepared (having read all assigned readings,
ready to engage).  I also expect active participation, not passive
reception to the material.  Your energy in contributing to class
discussions and hands-on exercises will make this class an enjoyable
experience for all of us.  Class participation is worth 10% of your
total grade.  In the beginning, everyone starts out with five points
(out of a total of ten).  Depending on the factors discussed above,
this total may go up or down.</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

The University of Maryland, College Park has a nationally recognized
Code of Academic Integrity, administered by the Student Honor
Council. This Code sets standards for academic integrity at Maryland
for all undergraduate and graduate students. As a student you are
responsible for upholding these standards for this course. It is very
important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the
Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit
