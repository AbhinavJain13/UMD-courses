<h2>Introduction to "Cloud Computing" (Fall 2008)</h2>

<h3>Problem Set 0: Getting onto the cloud</h3>

<p><b>Due:</b> Friday 9/12 (by 9:30am)</p>

<p>Consider this a warm-up exercise in getting acquainted with "the
cloud".  As discussed in class, one of the key ideas behind "cloud
computing" is the rapid provisioning of computing resources in large
data centers enabled by virtualization technology.  This is closely
related to the notion of "utility computing", where computing cycles
are treated like electricity, water, gas, etc.: available on demand,
and you pay for what you use.  In this class we'll be specifically
using
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon's Web Services</a>:
particularly, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2)</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Simple Storage
Service (S3)</a>.  Of course, do recognize that there are many
different "cloud providers" out there (see, for example,
<a href="http://www.gogrid.com">GoGrid</a>
and <a href="http://www.appnexus.com">AppNexus</a>)&mdash;but Amazon
seems to be the most mature at this time in terms of available
offerings.</p>

<p>For the 0th problem set, take a look
a <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/">Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup></a>,
a Hadoop library I've written that will help get you started with
MapReduce in Hadoop.  Go through the tutorial
on <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/content/start-EC2.html">getting
started with EC2</a>: by the end of the tutorial, you will have
started your own Hadoop cluster on EC2 and run the basic word count
demo.  Of course, feel free to poke around the rest of the
documentation also.</p>

<h4>Deliverables</h4>

<p>This problem set is due by 9:30am, Wednesday 9/10.  Send me an
email, with "LBSC 878A: Problem Set 0" as the subject.  In the email
body, copy-and-paste verbatim the following statement: "I have
successfully completed Problem Set 0 as described on the course
homepage.  I was able to start a Hadoop cluster on EC2 and I have run
the cloud9 word count demo."</p>

<p>Make sure the statement is actually true, and that's it for problem
set 0!</p>
