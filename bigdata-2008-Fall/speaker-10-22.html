<p><b>Abstract</b></p>

<p>The IBM Intranet consists of more than 100M pages and serves a user
community of 350,000 people distributed across multiple
continents. The goal of Project ES2 is to build a scalable and easily
maintainable search engine for this intranet. To tackle this search
problem, ES2 employs sophisticated offline analytics combined with
intelligent runtime query matching. In the offline phase, pages
crawled from the intranet are pushed through a multi-stage pipeline
consisting of "local" (page-at-a-time) analysis, "global" (cross-page)
analysis, followed by intelligent tokenization and indexing. In
addition, the pages are continuously mined to discover new patterns
for local and global analysis.  In this talk, I will describe the
overall ES2 flow providing examples of local / global analysis and
associated mining tasks. ES2 was originally deployed as a
single-machine solution but to meet growing demands is currently being
migrated to a 30-node Hadoop cluster. This leads to several
challenging research issues, both in translating the overall flow onto
Hadoop, as well as in mapping the analysis and mining algorithms onto
the MapReduce paradigm. I will illustrate these challenges by walking
through the mapping of a few example algorithms.</p>
