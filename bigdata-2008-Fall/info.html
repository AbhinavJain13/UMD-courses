<h2>Introduction to "Cloud Computing" (Fall 2008)</h2>

<div class="main">

<h3>Course Description</h3>

<p>What exactly is
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud
computing</a>"?  Ask five people and you'll get eight different
answers&mdash;but many will agree on the following trends:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Many meaningful tasks require the processing of larger and
  larger datasets (so-called "Web-scale" problems).  This requires
  harnessing the power of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of
  machines.</li>

  <li>Due to economies of scale and the development of virtualization
  technology, utility computing is an emerging model for provisioning
  computing resources.  In other words, one could "rent" computing
  cycles instead of buying machines.</li>

  <li>Highly-interactive applications can be delivered from "within
  the clouds", perhaps replacing traditional desktop software as we
  know today.</li>

</ul>

<p>In recognition of these trends, this course will focus on two
specific technologies:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce"><b>MapReduce</b></a>,
  via the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/"><b>Hadoop</b></a>
  open-source implementation.  MapReduce is a distributed programming
  model developed by Google; it provides a high-level functional
  abstraction that allows a one to write programs that are
  transparently distributed over a computer cluster.</li>

  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)"><b>Ajax</b></a>
  (asynchronous JavaScript and XML), a group of interrelated
  technologies used for creating interactive Web applications.</li>

</ul>

<p>One way to understand the relationship between these two
technologies is to think of MapReduce as the "back-end" of cloud
computing&mdash;large batch jobs that crunch a lot of data.
The results of these analyses would be served to users on the
"front-end" through interactive Web applications, and Ajax is emerging
as the dominant technology for developing such applications.</p>

<p>What better way to run a "cloud computing" course but in the clouds
itself?  Thanks to generous support from Amazon, students in this
course will be given access to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon
Web Services</a>, and will be literally working "in the clouds".</p>
