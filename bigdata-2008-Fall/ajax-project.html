<h2>Introduction to "Cloud Computing" (Fall 2008)</h2>

<div class="main">

<h3>Ajax mini-project</h3>

<p><b>Due:</b> Monday 11/3 (by 9:30am)</p>

<p>This open-ended individual project provides an opportunity for you
to demonstrate your mastery of Ajax.  You can work on whatever you
want, provided that it showcases the key ideas behind Ajax:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Rich, interactive Web-based applications.</li>

  <li>Asynchronous exchange of data with backend services.</li>

  <li>Dynamic content without need to reload Web pages.</li>

</ul>

<p>The scope of the project should be approximately equal to two
problem sets.  Your project must contain the following elements:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Ajax and dynamic content.</li>

  <li>Some type of service that provides a non-trivial amount of
  computation (use whatever language you're most comfortable with:
  PHP, Perl, Python, Java, etc.).</li>

  <li>Access to a non-trivial amount of data, either managed by
  yourself (e.g., in a mySQL database) or provided via a Web service
  (e.g., using a map API to create a mashup).</li>

  <li>Your project must run in the clouds.  You must either use an
  instance on EC2 or another cloud computing service like
  the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App
  Engine</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Feel free to discuss ideas and collaborate with others in the
course, but you must complete your own assignment.  For example,
trading coding tips and code fragments (e.g., over email or IM) would
be fine, but sharing entire project files would not be.</p>

<p>This assignment is due 11/3 by 9:30am.  Class session that Monday
will be devoted to an Ajax "show-and-tell".  Make sure your project is
running in the clouds before you arrive at class that day (i.e.,
accessible in a browser at some public URL).  You will have three
minutes (no more!) to quickly show everyone what you've done.  Also,
before you get to class, send me an email, with "LBSC 878A: Ajax
mini-project" as the subject.  In the message, attach a PowerPoint
presentation with screenshots of your system (as many as you feel
necessary to highlight key features of your system).  You can use this
presentation as backup if your project system does not work or is not
accessible (but you are still subject to the time limit).  These
screenshots will also provide a more permanent record of your system.
After class, you can terminate your EC2 instance.</p>

<p>This assignment will be graded along the same scale as the problem
sets.  Both your presentation and the system screenshots will be taken
into account in your grade.</p>

<p>If you are looking for interesting datasets, you might want to take
a look at the <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/">StatLib (from
CMU)</a> (click "Get Data" on the left and look under "Datasets
Archive").  Just browsing through the collection, the following struck
me as potentially interesting:</p>

<ul>

  <li>baseball.data: performance and salary information on baseball
  players during the 1986 season.</li>

  <li>DJ 1985-2003: daily quote of stocks in the Dow Jones, from 1985
  to 2003.</li>

  <li>fl2000: County data from the 2000 Presidential Election in
  Florida.</li>

</ul>

<p>Another source of interesting datasets is
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UCI Machine Learning
Repository</a>.  Of course, feel free to use any dataset you
wish&mdash;these are merely suggestions.</p>
