<h2>LBSC 796/INFM 718R: Homework 1</h2>

course (Fall, 2004)</a> at U. Mass.</p>

<h3>Part 1: Gathering Relevance Judgments</h3>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to gain some "hands-on" experience
in the process of evaluating information retrieval systems.  You will
be assessing documents that are retrieved in response to two "topics"
(statements of information needs).  The two search engines we'll be
comparing are <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and <a
href="http://www.teoma.com/">Teoma</a>.</p>

<ol>

<li><p><i>gardening wet soil conditions</i><br/> What special
considerations must be made when planting a garden in very wet soil
conditions?  Are there plants that will not work and/or that will work
particularly well?  Are there any special techniques that will help
reduce the amount of moisture?  Only pages that deal with gardening
are relevant. 

<br/>[<a href="hw1/google.query1.htm">Google results</a>] [<a
href="hw1/teoma.query1.htm">Teoma results</a>]</p></li>

<li><p><i>oil vs. propane furnace</i><br/> Looking for pages that list
the tradeoffs for using a propane furnace rather than a fuel oil
furnace. The pages should provide comparison and are only relevant if
they talk about both. They can talk about other types of heating
(e.g., electric), provided they talk about oil and propane. Propane is
also called LP or LPG (liquid propane [gas]). 

<br/> [<a
href="hw1/google.query2.htm">Google results</a>] [<a
href="hw1/teoma.query2.htm">Teoma results</a>]</p></li>

</ol>

<p>To ensure that everyone evaluates the same hits, results from each
search engine have been cached for you; follow the above links.  You
will evaluate the relevance of a subset of these hits.  If your social
security number ends in an even digit, evaluate the first 15 hits of
each query.  If you social security number ends in an odd digit,
evaluate the last 15 hits of each query.</p>

<p>Use this <a href="hw1results.xls">Excel spreadsheet</a> to keep
track of your relevance judgments.  In the column marked "Relevance",
enter "R" if you think the document is relevant.  Enter "N" if you
think the document is not relevant.  Email the results back to Lynne,
who will gather the judgments from everyone.  Change the name of the
spreadsheet to your last name so that Lynne does not receive a dozen
files with the same filename.</p>

<h3>Part 2: Evaluating Systems</h3>

<p>This <a href="hw1judged.xls">Excel spreadsheet</a> contains three
separate sets of judgments for the hits examined in part one of the
homework.</p>

<p>In the second part of this assignment, for <b>one</b> of the
topics, you will</p>

<ol>
  <li>analyze agreement on the relevance judgments</li>
  <li>adjudicate the judgments</li>
  <li>use the adjudicated set to evaluate both Teoma and Google</li>
</ol>

<p><b>1. Agreement on Relevance Judgments</b></p>

<p>The above spreadsheet should contain three sets of judgments for
every document (Web page).  The first question you'll answer is: How
often do judges agree on relevance?  There are four possibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>RRR</b>: all three judges agree that the document is relevant.

  <li><b>NNN</b>: all three judges agree that the document is not
  relevant.</li>

  <li><b>RRN</b>: two of the three judges agree that the document is
  relevant.</li>

  <li><b>NNR</b>: two of the three judges agree that the document is
  not relevant.</li>
</ul>

<p>For your chosen topic, figure out how often each case happens (both
in terms of counts and in terms of percentage).  Turn this information
in.  Pick three cases where judgments about a particular hit are not
uniform, and <i>briefly</i> speculate why this may be so.  Try to
employ the concepts of relevance discussed in lecture.  Turn this
in.</p>

<p><b>2. Adjudication</b></p>

<p>Adjudication is simply the process of reconciling inconsistent
judgments.  Do this by simple majority voting.  You do not need to
turn anything in for this, but you will need the results for the third
question.</p>

<p><b>3. Evaluation of Teoma and Google</b></p>

<p>Now, evaluate Teoma and Google using the adjudicated relevance
judgments you just created (for the topic you chose).  <b>Make sure
you are pooling judgments from both systems!</b> Turn in the following
information for both search engines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Precision at 10, 20, 30</li>
  <li>Recall at 10, 20, 30</li>
  <li>Precision at each of the 11 standard recall levels (interpolated)</li>
  <li>The precision-recall graph</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which system is better?  Why?</li>

  <li>What is the assumption we're making with respect to the
  completeness of the judgment set?  What are the implications on our
  evaluation?</li>
