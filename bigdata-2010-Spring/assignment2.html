<h3>Data-Intensive Information Processing Applications (Spring 2010)</h3>

<h2>Assignment 2: Bigram Counts</h2>

<p><b>Due:</b> Tuesday 2/23 (2pm)</p>

<p>Complete
the <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/exercises/bigrams.html">bigram
count exercise</a> in Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup>.  The exercise
contains two parts, with four questions in Part I and three questions
in Part II.  Answer all these questions.  You may complete this
portion of the assignment in standalone mode if you wish.
Alternatively, if you wish to use the Google/IBM cluster, the sample
dataset (the Bible and the complete works of Shakespeare) is loaded at
/tmp/sample-data.</p>

<p>After you've completed Part I and Part II of the above exercise,
you're going to make sure that everything runs "at scale" over the
Wikipedia collection stored at /tmp/wiki on the Google/IBM cluster
(also used in the previous assignment).</p>

<h3>Part III</h3>

<p>Count the bigrams on the Wikipedia collection (as in Part I of the
exercise above).  Make sure your job successfully completes on the
entire collection.  Put your output (complete bigram counts for the
entire collection) in /tmp/lin-course/bigrams-USERNAME. Substitute
USERNAME with your actual username <b>without</b> the "ccc_"
prefix. Therefore, I would put my output in
/tmp/lin-course/bigrams-jimmylin.  It is important that you follow
these instructions <b>exactly</b>, because this is where we are going
to look for your output.</p>

<p><b>Hint:</b> For these large jobs, run around 100-200 reducers.
You want enough reducers to get good parallelism, but you don't want
to run too many reducers as to consume all cluster resources (leaving
none for others).</p>

<p><b>Question 1.</b> What is your job id?  If you ran the code more
than once, any job id of a successful run will do.  Save the job
details page and attach it as part of your answer.  That is, from the
jobtracker webapp, find your job, save that page in HTML, and include
it in your assignment submission.  Name this file part3q1.htm.</p>

<p><b>Question 2.</b> For the job id you identified above, how many
map tasks and reduce tasks did the job contain?  How long did the job
take?</p>

<p><b>Question 3.</b> How many unique bigrams are there in the entire
collection?</p>

<p><b>Question 4.</b> What are the counts of the following bigrams?</p>

<ul>

  <li>"really happy"</li>
  <li>"deliriously happy"</li>
  <li>"happy accident"</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Hint:</b> There's no reason why you couldn't write a separate
program to find these counts.</p>

<h3>Part IV</h3>

<p>Now, compute bigram probabilities on the Wikipedia collection (as
in Part II of the exercise above).  Make sure your job successfully
completes on the entire dataset.  Put your output (bigram
probabilities for the entire collection) in
/tmp/lin-course/condprob-USERNAME. Substitute USERNAME with your
actual username <b>without</b> the "ccc_" prefix. Therefore, I would
put my output in /tmp/lin-course/condprob-jimmylin.  It is important
that you follow these instructions <b>exactly</b>, because this is
where we are going to look for your output.</p>

<p><b>Hint:</b> Depending on how you implement your algorithm,
computing bigram probabilities <i>should</i> be relatively quick
(around 10-15 minutes or less).  If it's taking significantly longer,
you should rethink your algorithm.  Don't leave an errant job running
on the cluster for too long: kill it with "hadoop job -kill".  A
"pairs" solution of this problem is probably the easiest&mdash;you
might want to look at edu.umd.cloud9.demo.DemoWordCondProb in
Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> as a starting point.  Despite its
deficiencies, "pairs" will scale fine to this collection.</p>

<p><b>Question 1.</b> What is your job id?  If you ran the code more
than once, any job id of a successful run will do.  Save the job
details page and attach it as part of your answer.  That is, from the
jobtracker webapp, find your job, save that page in HTML, and include
it in your assignment submission.  Name this file part4q1.htm.</p>

<p><b>Question 2.</b> For the job id you identified above, how many
map tasks and reduce tasks did the job contain?  How long did the job
take?</p>

<p><b>Question 3.</b> Compare the running time of the bigram counting
algorithm and the bigram probabilities algorithm (question 2 from Part
III and and question 2 from Part IV).  Factoring away variations in
cluster load (i.e., how many other jobs are running), can you explain
the differences in running time?  Which algorithm should take longer
and why?</p>

<p><b>Question 4.</b> What is P(birthday|happy)?</p>

<p><b>Hint:</b> There's no reason why you couldn't write a separate
program to answer this specific question.</p>

<p><b>Question 5.</b> How long did it take you to complete this
assignment (Parts I through IV)?</p>

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

<p>This assignment is due by 2pm, Tuesday 2/23.  Please send us (both
Jimmy and Nitin) an email with "Cloud Computing Course: Assignment 2"
as the subject.  In the body of the email put answers to the questions
above.  If you have collaborated with anyone else or have received any
assistance in completing this assignment, you must tell us.</p>

<p>Pack up your code into a zip file named USERNAME-code.zip, and
attach it your assignment submission.  So for example, I would pack up
my code in a file named jimmylin-code.zip.  Once again, please follow
these instructions <b>exactly</b>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The Google/IBM cluster is a shared resource accessible
by many.  Any impropriety on the cluster will be taken very seriously.
This includes tampering or attempting to tamper with another student's
results, attempting to pass another student's result as one's own,
etc.  See the <a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu/">Code of Academic
Integrity or the Student Honor Council</a> for more information.</p>
