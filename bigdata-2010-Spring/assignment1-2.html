<h3>Data-Intensive Information Processing Applications (Spring 2010)</h3>

<h2>Assignment 1-2: Getting into the Clouds</h2>

<p><b>Due:</b> Tuesday 2/9 (2pm)</p>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with running
Hadoop in two different ways: on the Google/IBM cluster and on EC2.
It is the second part follow-up
to <a href="assignment1-1.html">Assignment 1-1</a> and builds directly
on it.</p>

<p>First, let's start with the Google/IBM cluster.  You should have
received separate instructions on account creation.  Remember, when
selecting a username, please prefix the username by "ccc_", so that,
for example, I would be "ccc_jimmylin".  This allows us to distinguish
students in the class from other cluster users.</p>

<p>On the cluster, we've prepped a raw text dump of Wikipedia for you
to play with:</p>

<pre>
hadoop fs -ls /tmp/wiki
</pre>

<p>You can check out the contents with something like this:</p>

<pre>
hadoop fs -cat /tmp/wiki/part-00000 | head
</pre>

<p>Now, run the word count demo on this dataset, with 100 reducers, as
such:</p>

<pre>
hadoop jar cloud9.jar edu.umd.cloud9.demo.DemoWordCount /tmp/wiki /tmp/lin-course/cnt1-USERNAME 200 100
</pre>

<p>Substitute USERNAME with your actual username <b>without</b> the
"ccc_" prefix. Therefore, I would put the output in
/tmp/lin-course/cnt1-jimmylin.  It is important that you follow these
instructions <b>exactly</b>, because this is where we are going to
look for your output.</p>

<p><b>Question 1.</b> What is your job id?  If you ran the code more
than once, any job id of a successful run will do.</p>

<p><b>Question 2.</b> How large is the input data? (Hint, look in the jobtracker webapp.)</p>

<p><b>Question 3.</b> How many map tasks does your job contain?</p>

<p><b>Question 4.</b> What is the 6th word in part-00042 and how many
times does it appear?</p>

<p>You'll notice that there is a lot of "junk" in the output.  Let's
try to clean this up by throwing away terms that don't appear often.
Modify the word count demo so to retain only words that occur more
than 100 times (i.e., cnt > 100).</p>

<p>Once you've modified the program, run it again:</p>

<pre>
hadoop jar cloud9.jar edu.umd.cloud9.demo.DemoWordCount /tmp/wiki /tmp/lin-course/cnt2-USERNAME 200 10
</pre>

<p>This time, use only 10 reducers.  Note the slightly different path
in which to put your results.</p>

<p><b>Question 5.</b> How many terms appear more than 100 times in the
collection?</p>

<p><b>Question 6.</b> How many time does "life" appear in the
collection?</p>

<p>Okay, we're done with exercises using the Google/IBM cluster.  Now
lets play with EC2.  You should have separately received tokens for
EC2.  First, go through all the steps described in 
<a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/content/start-EC2.html">this
tutorial</a> <b>except</b> Step 6 which asks you to terminate your cluster. You should
not terminate because you still have stuff to do after the tutorial. </p>

<p><b>Question 7.</b> Have you successfully completed the EC2
tutorial?  (<i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>)</p>

<p>Transfer part-00000 of the wiki data onto EC2 and run word count in
EC2.  Keep the changes to the code where you retain only words that
appear more than 100 times.</p>

<p><b>Question 8.</b> What words beginning with "c" appear 160 times
in this part of the collection?</p>

<p>You should now terminate your cluster (see above tutorial for
details). One final question:</p>

<p><b>Question 9.</b> How long did it take you to complete this
assignment?</p>

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

<p>This assignment is due by 2pm, Tuesday 2/9.   Please send us (both Jimmy and Nitin) an email with "Cloud Computing Course: Assignment 1-2" as the subject.
In the body of the email put answers to the questions above.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The Google/IBM cluster is a shared resource accessible
by many.  Any impropriety on the cluster will be taken very seriously.
This includes tampering or attempting to tamper with another student's
results, attempting to pass another student's result as one's own,
etc.  See the <a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu/">Code of Academic
Integrity or the Student Honor Council</a> for more information.</p>
