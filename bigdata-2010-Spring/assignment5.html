<h3>Data-Intensive Information Processing Applications (Spring 2010)</h3>

<h2>Assignment 5: Final Project Proposal</h2>

<p><b>Due:</b> Tuesday 3/30 (2pm)</p>

<p>In this assignment, you will tell us what you want to do for your
final project.  A few guidelines:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The project can focus on any topic you want, as long as it is
  related to themes of this course (MapReduce, large-data, cloud
  computing, etc.).  The project must either involve the Google/IBM
  cluster or Amazon Web Services.  We will discuss some project ideas
  in class. </li>

  <li>You can work in groups of up to three, but you can also work by
  yourself if you wish.  We would encourage a group final
  project.</li>

  <li>The amount of effort devoted to this project should be
  proportional to the number of people in the team.  We would expect a
  level of effort comparable to two or three assignments <i>per
  person</i> (since you have approximately a month to complete the
  project).</li>

  <li>You set your own grade.  Tell us what grade you want for the
  final project, and what you propose to do.  We'll determine if it
  sounds reasonable or not.  If you deliver what you promise, you'll
  get the grade you specified.  As advice, the tendency will be to
  promise more than you can deliver, so try to be realistic in what
  you can accomplish in the limited amount of time.</li>

  <li>Start early on the project.  Remember, there's also a final exam
  for the course and there is typically a lot going on at the end of
  the semester.  Poor time management is not an excuse for a low
  quality project.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

<p>This assignment is due by 2pm, Tuesday 3/30.  Please send us (both
Jimmy and Nitin) an email with "Cloud Computing Course: Assignment 5"
as the subject.  We only need one email per group.  In the body of the
email, provide the following information:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The group members.</li>

  <li>The grade you want.</li>

  <li>Description of your project.  We are expecting 1-2 pages
  (attachment is okay, but please send PDF) that describe the idea.
  Include: the data you wish to work on, the approach, and the
  expected results (something concrete that can be evaluated).</li>

</ul>
