<h3>Data-Intensive Information Processing Applications (Spring 2010)</h3>

<h2>Assignment 4: PageRank</h2>

<p><b>Due:</b> Friday 3/26 (2pm)</p>

<p>Complete
the <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/exercises/pagerank.html">PageRank
exercise</a> in Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup>.  The sample graphs
are loaded on the cluster at /tmp/sample-data.  Although you may debug
in standalone mode on your local machine, your final
solution <b>must</b> run on the cluster.</p>

<p><b>Question 1.</b> Describe your implementation.  In particular, I
want a discussion of your approach to the following:</p>

<ol>

  <li>handling the dangling nodes,</li>
  <li>incorporating the random jump factor, and</li>
  <li>checking for convergence.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>Question 2.</b> For each of the sample graphs (small, medium,
large), list the top ten nodes in order of descending PageRank
value.</p>

<p><b>Question 3.</b> For each of the sample graphs (small, medium,
large), save the job details page for one iteration and attach it as
part of your answer.  That is, from the jobtracker webapp, find your
job, save that page in HTML, and include it in your assignment
submission.</p>

<p><b>Question 4.</b> How long did it take you to complete this
assignment?</p>

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

<p>This assignment is due by 2pm, Friday 3/26.  Please send us (both
Jimmy and Nitin) an email with "Cloud Computing Course: Assignment 4"
as the subject.  In the body of the email put answers to the questions
above.  If you have collaborated with anyone else or have received any
assistance in completing this assignment, you must tell us.</p>

<p>Pack up your code into a zip file named USERNAME-code.zip, and
attach it your assignment submission.  So for example, I would pack up
my code in a file named jimmylin-code.zip.  Once again, please follow
these instructions <b>exactly</b>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The Google/IBM cluster is a shared resource accessible
by many.  Any impropriety on the cluster will be taken very seriously.
This includes tampering or attempting to tamper with another student's
results, attempting to pass another student's result as one's own,
etc.  See the <a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu/">Code of Academic
Integrity or the Student Honor Council</a> for more information.</p>

<p>For this assignment, you may not consult any existing
implementation of PageRank in MapReduce/Hadoop. Consulting the
implementation of any non-MapReduce implementation (e.g., in JUNG) is
fine.</p>
