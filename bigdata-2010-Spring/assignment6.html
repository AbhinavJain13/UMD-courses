<h3>Data-Intensive Information Processing Applications (Spring 2010)</h3>

<h2>Assignment 6: Word Count with DryadLINQ</h2>

<p><b>Due:</b> Tuesday 4/27 (2pm)</p>

<p>Before you start, make sure you've read the Dryad and DryadLINQ
papers assigned in class.  You will also find this
helpful: <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/66811/programming-dryadlinq-dec2009.pdf">Some
sample programs written in DryadLINQ</a>.</p>

<p>Start Windows Remote Desktop.  Log into the Dryad cluster with the
credentials distributed in class.  Keep in mind that this is a shared
account everyone in the course will use, so be careful!</p>

<h3>Partitioned Files</h3>

<p>First, let's understand the notion of a partitioned file in
DryadLINQ.  A partitioned file on disk consist of two parts:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The pieces of data themselves.</li>

  <li>The metadata that relates the pieces together.</li>

</ul>

<p>In DryadLINQ, there is no equivalent of HDFS (at least in the
academic release we have access to).  So the pieces of data reside on
the local disks of the cluster nodes.  Let's start off by examining
these files.</p>

<p>Go to the Start menu, and in the "Start Search" box, type
<code>\\tempest-cn01</code>.  A window should pop up allowing you to
explore the file system on the remote node.  Go into
folder <code>DryadData &gt; jjlin</code>: you should find a file named
<code>InputPart.00000000</code>.  You will see something like
this:</p>

<p><img src="images/DryadLINQ-file.png" alt="Browsing a file in DryadLINQ"/></p>

<p>You should be able to open the file in notepad and examine its
contents.  Now go to the same location on cluster
nodes <code>tempest-cn02</code>, <code>tempest-cn03</code>, <code>tempest-cn04</code>.
Open the InputPart files in notepad.  They should all look familiar.
Be careful not to modify these files, as others will be examining them
also.</p>

<p><b>Question 1.</b> Write down the first line of text in each of the
four text files on the four cluster nodes.  This will demonstrate that
you have indeed examined all four partitions.</p>

<p>On the desktop you should find a file
named <code>InputParts.pt</code>; open up that file in notepad.  Its
contents should look like this:</p>

<pre>
DryadData\jjlin\InputPart
4
0,0,tempest-cn01
1,0,tempest-cn02
2,0,tempest-cn03
3,0,tempest-cn04
</pre>

<p>The is the metadata that describe each of the pieces of this
partitioned file.</p>

<p>As a note, there is currently no command-line mechanism to
partition a large file into pieces and distribute to each node (i.e.,
there is no equivalent of a <code>hadoop fs -put</code> command).  You
can perform the partitioning programmatically, but for this exercise,
I had to manually copy each file onto each node.</p>

<h3>Running WordCount</h3>

<p>Click the Start button and launch the HPC Job Manager.  If the icon
isn't in the Start menu, you can search for it.  It should look
something like this:</p>

<p><img src="images/DryadLINQ-jobmanager.png" alt="HPC Job Manager"/></p>

<p>Put it aside for now.  This is the closest equivalent to the Hadoop
Jobtracker in DryadLINQ, and through this application you'll be able
to monitor the progress of your DryadLINQ job.</p>

<p>On the desktop, you should find a folder
called <code>samples</code>.  Open the folder, and inside find a
folder named <code>Histogram</code>.  This is the word count example.
Make a copy of that folder on the desktop, and append your name to the
folder name: something like <code>Histogram-Jimmy</code>.  This way
you will have your own copy of the code and will not affect other
people who may be logged in at the same time.</p>

<p>Go into the new folder you've created.  Double click on the Visual
C# Project File named <code>Histogram</code>, and it should start
Visual Studio.  On the right hand box you should
find <code>Program.cs</code>; click on it and you should see the
source code for the word count example.  The code is repeated
here: <a href="DryadLINQ-wc.cs">complete C# code for the word count
example in DryadLINQ</a>.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the <code>BuildHistogram</code> method, which
is where the action takes place:</p>

<pre>
public static IQueryable&lt;Pair&gt; BuildHistogram(
                    string directory,
                    string fileName,
                    int k)
{
    string uri = DataPath.FileUriPrefix + Path.Combine(directory, fileName);
    PartitionedTable&lt;LineRecord&gt; inputTable = PartitionedTable.Get&lt;LineRecord&gt;(uri);

    IQueryable&lt;string&gt; words = inputTable.SelectMany(x =&gt; x.line.Split(' '));
    IQueryable&lt;IGrouping&lt;string, string&gt;&gt; groups = words.GroupBy(x =&gt; x);
    IQueryable&lt;Pair&gt; counts = groups.Select(x =&gt; new Pair(x.Key, x.Count()));
    IQueryable&lt;Pair&gt; ordered = counts.OrderByDescending(x =&gt; x.Count);
    IQueryable&lt;Pair&gt; top = ordered.Take(k);

    return top;
}
</pre>

<p>First, we tell DryadLINQ where to get the input files:</p>

<pre>
string uri = DataPath.FileUriPrefix + Path.Combine(directory, fileName);
PartitionedTable&lt;LineRecord&gt; inputTable = PartitionedTable.Get&lt;LineRecord&gt;(uri);
</pre>

<p>This is equivalent in Hadoop to specifying the
TextInputFormat. Next:</p>

<pre>
IQueryable&lt;string&gt; words = inputTable.SelectMany(x =&gt; x.line.Split(' '));
</pre>

<p>The SelectMany method transforms a scalar into a list.  The following:</p>

<pre>
x =&gt; x.line.Split(' ')
</pre>

<p>can be understood as a lambda expression.  So if the input were "A
B B C", the output would be ["A", "B", "B", "C"].  The next line of
code performs a group by:</p>

<pre>
IQueryable&lt;IGrouping&lt;string, string&gt;&gt; groups = words.GroupBy(x =&gt; x);
</pre>

<p>If the input were ["A", "B", "B", "C"], the output would be [
["A"], ["B", "B"], ["C"]].  The next line creates Pair objects from
the groups:</p>

<pre>
IQueryable&lt;Pair&gt; counts = groups.Select(x =&gt; new Pair(x.Key, x.Count()));
</pre>

<p>And finally, we sort by count and take the top <i>k</i>.</p>

<pre>
IQueryable&lt;Pair&gt; ordered = counts.OrderByDescending(x =&gt; x.Count);
IQueryable&lt;Pair&gt; top = ordered.Take(k);
</pre>

<p>Got it?  Now let's try running the code.</p>

<p>In the Visual Studio toolbar next to the dropdown box that says
"Debug", there should be an icon that's a green arrow pointing to the
right.  Click on that button.  A command-line window should pop up and
some code should scroll by, showing you something like this:</p>

<img src="images/DryadLINQ-submission.png" alt="DryadLINQ submission"/>

<p>This means your job has been queued.  An instant later it should
start running, and you should be able to see the job in the HPC Job
Manager from above.</p>

<p><b>Question 2.</b> After your job completes, the command-line
window should show the results.  Write down the five most
frequently-occurring words in the collection and their counts, to
demonstrate that you've successfully run the job.</p>

<p><b>Question 3.</b> Modify the code so that it displays the first
five words (ordered in reverse alphabetical order) and their counts
from the collection.  In other words, suppose I arranged all words in
the collection alphabetically.  I want the counts of the last five
words (starting from the last word).  This requires changing only one
token in the code.  Write down what that change is.</p>
