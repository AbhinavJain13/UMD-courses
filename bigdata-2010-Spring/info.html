<h2>Data-Intensive Information Processing Applications (Spring 2010)</h2>

<h3>What's the course about?</h3>

<p>This course is about scalable approaches to processing large
amounts of information (terabytes and even petabytes).  We focus
mostly on MapReduce, which is presently the most accessible and
practical means of computing at this scale, but will discuss other
approaches as well.</p>

<p>MapReduce is a programming model for expressing distributed
computations on massive amounts of information and an execution
framework for large-scale information processing on clusters of
commodity servers.  It was originally developed by Google and built on
well-known principles in parallel and distributed processing dating
back several decades.  MapReduce has since enjoyed widespread adoption
via an open-source implementation called <a
href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a>, whose development was led
by Yahoo.</p>

<p>This is the "version 3.0" of a course that was previously offered
in <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud-2008-Fall/index.html">Spring
2008</a>
and <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud-2008-Spring/index.html">Fall
2008</a>.  Core content is similar, but organization and scope have
been overhauled for the third time.</p>

<p>Course readings will be drawn from research papers available
online, as well as the following two textbooks:</p>

<ul>

<li>Tom White, <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596521981">Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</a>, O'Reilly, 2009. (The full text of this book is available to UMD students via <a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/">Safari Books Online</a>, but you may choose to purchase a paper copy for handy reference)
</li>

<li>Jimmy Lin and Chris Dyer, <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/book.html">Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce</a>, forthcoming, 2010.</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition to the standard distributions of Hadoop, this course
uses <a
href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/index.html">Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup></a>,
a MapReduce library for Hadoop developed at the University of Maryland.</p>

<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>

<p>No previous experience with MapReduce or parallel and distributed
programming is necessary.  However, students taking this course should
be competent Java programmers, since concepts taught in class will be
reinforced through extensive programming exercises in the Hadoop
implementation of MapReduce (which is in Java).  Note that this is a
course on algorithms and "thinking at scale"&mdash;not about Hadoop
programming.  Therefore, we expect you to "pick up" the details of the
Hadoop API <b>without explicit instruction from us</b>.  Of course, we
will assist you by providing resources and a reasonable amount of
guidance.</p>

<p>In addition, students are assumed to have knowledge of basic
probability and statistics (e.g., axioms of probability, Bayes'
Theorem, relative frequency estimation, etc.) and also a solid
understanding of basic computer architecture (e.g., microprocessor
architectures, memory hierarchies, cache coherence protocols,
etc.).</p>

<h3>Course Grade</h3>

<ul>

  <li><b>Exams (50%)</b>: There will be a midterm exam (25%) and a
  final exam (25%). CS MS comp grade (software engineering area) will
  be based entirely on the average of the two exams. </li>

  <li><b>Final project (30%):</b> There will be group final project
  (~3 students) on a topic of your own choosing.  More details on this
  will be discussed later on in the semester. </li>

  <li><b>Class assignments (15%):</b> There will be six assignments,
  but we will drop your lowest grade and take the average of five
  assignment grades.  Each assignment grade is worth 3% of your course
  grade.</li>

  <li><b>Class participation (5%):</b> Showing up for class,
  demonstrating preparedness (i.e., doing the readings), and
  contributing to class discussions.</li>

</ul>

<p>See <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> for assignment due dates
and exams dates.</p>

<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>

<p>The homework assignments are designed to help you learn the
material, and will not primarily be used as an evaluative tool.  As a
result, they are not worth a large percentage of your final course
grade, relative to the effort that should be devoted to them.</p>

<p>Assignments will be graded on a five-point scale, described
below.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Score = 0: no credit (e.g., you failed to turn in the
  assignment).</li>

  <li>Score = 1: serious deficiencies (i.e., you missed significant
  portions of the assignment or a significant number of the answers
  were incorrect.</li>

  <li>Score = 2: adequate completion (i.e., most of the answers were
  correct, but there were some missing or incorrect answers).</li>

  <li>Score = 3: satisfactory completion (i.e., everything or nearly
  everything was correct).</li>

  <li>Score = 4: impressive mastery (i.e., you went above and beyond
  what was asked for in the assignment).</li>

</ul>

<p>A score of 4 will only be given out in extraordinary cases.  A
score of 3 indicates "A" quality work.</p>

<h3>Policy for Late and Incomplete Work</h3>

<ul>

  <li><b>Assignment deadlines:</b> Assignments are due at the
  beginning of class unless otherwise noted.</li>

  <li><b>Late assignments:</b> If an assignment is late by up to 24
  hours, the grade will be reduced by 20%.  By 48 hours, 40%. And so
  forth.  Exceptions can be discussed in cases of medical excuses,
  family emergencies, etc., but being busy is not a valid excuse.
  Exceptions will only be considered <i>prior</i> to the deadline, and
  the sooner you talk to us about a problem the more likely we will be
  sympathetic.  There are several common problems that we are unlikely
  to consider as valid reasons for failing to get work in on time.
  These include (a) failure to manage your time properly, (b)
  discovering an assignment is harder or takes longer than you
  expected it to be (see item a), (c) having competing priorities such
  as other classes, job interviews, etc., and (d) losing code or data
  that should have been backed up, unless it's someone else's
  fault.</li>

  <li><b>'Incomplete' as a grade:</b> We will not issue an
  'incomplete' as a grade except for serious, valid reasons, generally
  in the category of emergencies.  See above for some reasons unlikely
  to be considered valid.  If you are having problems of any kind,
  please talk to us as soon as possible. </li>

</ul>

<h3>Academic Integrity </h3>

<p>The University of Maryland, College Park has a nationally recognized
Code of Academic Integrity, administered by the Student Honor Council.
This Code sets standards for academic integrity at Maryland for all
undergraduate and graduate students. As a student you are responsible
for upholding these standards for this course. It is very important
for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication,
facilitation, and plagiarism. Please visit
the <a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu/">Code of Academic Integrity or
the Student Honor Council</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

<p>Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should:
(1) register with and provide documentation to
the <a href="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/DSS/">Disability Support
Services office</a>, and (2) discuss any necessary academic
accommodation with me.  This should be done at the beginning of the
semester, within the first three class sessions.</p>


<h3>Emergency Preparedness</h3>

<p>Information about the status of the campus is available
at <a href="http://www.umd.edu/emergencypreparedness/">the campus
emergency preparedness website</a>.  If the campus is closed, please
make sure to stay safe. Information about possible rescheduling of
course activities will be provided via e-mail once the campus has
reopened.</p>
