<hr/>
<h2>Final Project</h2>

<p><a href="index.html">Back to main page</a></p>

<p>In contrast to the first two design projects, the final project is
totally open ended.  You will work in groups of four to develop an
information architecture on a topic of your choosing.  In terms of
scope and content, the final project should be slightly larger than
the second design project.</p>

<p>The final project <b>must</b> have the following elements:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The project must have a user or a target group of users, real or
  imagined.  It is preferable that the users are real and that you are
  not the users (to give you an opportunity to practice the various
  techniques discussed in the formative evaluation class
  session).</li>

  <li>The project must have a substantial amount of content and a
  non-trivial organization.  The amount of content should be slightly
  more than the second design project, but not much more.  An example
  of trivial organization is the phone book; the point is to exercise
  information architecture principles!</li>

  <li>The project must make use of at least one advanced technology.
  By advanced technology I mean something beyond HTML/CSS.  For
  example, a database backend (mySQL/PHP combination),
  JavaScript/AJAX, XML/XSLT would all qualify.  Of course, the
  technology must support your information architecture in a
  meaningful way.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>The final project is due May 12, 2008.  Each group will be given 15
minutes to present their work in class, with up to 5 minutes for
questions and discussion.  Your presentation should explicitly cover
the three required elements of the project.</p>

<p>The grade for this project will be broken down into six components,
each worth 5 points (for a total for 30 points):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Overall organization system</li>
  <li>Overall navigation system</li>
  <li>Layout, design, and structure of individual Web pages</li>
  <li>Use and integration of advanced technology</li>
  <li>Degree to which the information architecture addresses user needs</li>
  <li>In-class presentation</li>
</ul>

<p>I expect all design projects to be delivered on time.  If you are
not ready for your presentation, you will receive a zero for that
component.  For every 24-hour period that the remaining deliverables
are late, I will deduct 20% from the grade.</p>
