<h2>Design Project 2: Publications Page for Faculty</h2>

<p><a href="index.html">Back to main page</a></p>

<p>In this project, you will design and build a publications page for
a faculty in the iSchool.  For convenience, I will simply refer to the
product a publications page, although in reality it may be a
collection of separate pages (or a complete site in
itself).</p>

<p>For this project, you will be working with four faculty "clients".
They are listed below, along with their areas of research:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~allisond/">Allison
  Druin</a>, Associate Professor: human computer interaction (HCI),
  children's information access and use.</li>

  <li><a href="http://clis.umd.edu/people/hahn/index.shtml">Trudi
  Hahn</a>, Professor of the Practice: history of information science
  and technology, information policy, information literacy.</li>

  <li><a href="http://clis.umd.edu/people/klavans/index.shtml">Judith
  Klavans</a>, Research Professor: natural language processing,
  digital libraries, linguistics.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.glue.umd.edu/~oard/">Doug Oard</a>,
  Associate Professor and Associate Dean for Research: information
  retrieval, user modeling.</li>

</ul>

<p>The class will be divided into eight teams; two teams will work
with each faculty member (but each team will be responsible for
separate deliverables).  The goal of the project is to design and
build a publications page for your assigned faculty client.  Here's
what you will start out with:</p>

<ul>

  <li>A curriculum vitae from the faculty client, with a list of
  publications.</li>

  <li>An opportunity to meet with the faculty.  Both teams will meet
  with the faculty at the same time for an hour.  It is not a
  requirement, but certainly desirable that every team member attends
  this meeting (subject to schedule constraints).  It is your
  responsibility to arrange the meeting at a mutually convenient time.
  Given the busy schedule of faculty members, I advise not delaying on
  this and aiming for a meeting sometime during the week of March 24.
  It is your choice how to use this time, but the basic focus should
  be to solicit design requirements from the client.</li>

</ul>

<p>The deliverable for this project is a publication page for the
assigned faculty client and associated in-class presentation (see
below). As with the first design project, wireframes are sufficient,
but appropriate graphic design can certainly enhance the presentation.
I expect appropriate use of CSS as well as any relevant
technology.</p>

<p>Each group will be given 15 minutes to present their work in class,
with up to 5 minutes for questions and discussion.  Your presentation
should cover the following:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Who is my client?  What are his or her research interests?</li>

  <li>What are the design requirements?  The faculty client is
  naturally the primary source, but additional sources include: nature
  of the research field, professional associations, and other
  "context" factors.</li>

  <li>How did you translate these design requirements into a
  publications page? (Provide a demo.)</li>

  <li>What worked well?  What didn't?  How did you know?</li>

</ul>

<p>This assignment is intentionally vague on specifications because it
depends on the individual faculty client.  It is your job to figure
out what needs to be built, and then built it.  Note that beyond the
initial meeting, you will most likely have limited opportunity for
intermediate feedback and iterative design.  You should treat the
initial meeting as your only opportunity to interact with the
client.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>This design project is due on April 14, 2008, before 6pm.  The
class session for that day will be reserved for the in-class
presentations.  In addition, you will:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Post your design project on-line and email me the URL.  I will
  post links to everyone's design project on this page so that you may
  learn from each other.</li>

  <li>Prepare a USB flash drive that contains all files associated
  with your design project.  I will copy the files onto my laptop and
  return the drive in class.</li>

</ul>

<p>The grade for this project will be broken down into six components,
each worth 5 points (for a total for 30 points):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Overall organization system</li>
  <li>Overall navigation system</li>
  <li>Layout, design, and structure of individual Web pages</li>
  <li>Sustainability and maintainability of the site</li>
  <li>In-class presentation</li>
  <li>Input from faculty "client"</li>
</ul>

<p>I expect all design projects to be delivered on time.  If you are
not ready for your presentation, you will receive a zero for that
component.  For every 24-hour period that the remaining deliverables
are late, I will deduct 20% from the grade.</p>
